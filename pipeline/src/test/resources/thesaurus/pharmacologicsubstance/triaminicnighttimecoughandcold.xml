<Description>A commercial combination preparation, by Novartis, containing chlorpheniramine maleate, dextromethorphan hydrobromide and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride used to relieve symptoms of cold and flu. Chlorpheniramine maleate, an antihistamine, blocks the effects of histamine, thereby preventing symptoms such as sneezing and itchy, watery eyes, runny nose and sore throat. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide exerts antitussive activity by raising the threshold for coughing in the cough center. Pseudoephedrine, a sympathomimetic agent, acts as a decongestant by constricting blood vessels due to stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors, thereby reducing blood flow which decreases swelling and prevents nasal and sinus congestion.</Description>
