<Description>A metal halide composed of sodium and chloride with sodium and chloride replacement capabilities. When depleted in the body, sodium must be replaced in order to maintain intracellular osmolarity, nerve conduction, muscle contraction and normal renal function.</Description>
<Description>A ubiquitous sodium salt that is commonly used to season food. It plays an important biological role in maintaining the osmotic tension of blood and tissues. The OSMOLAR CONCENTRATION this and other SALTS accounts for SALINITY which influences the types of organisms that live in an ENVIRONMENT.</Description>
