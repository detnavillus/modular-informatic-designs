<Description>Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) harvested from the blood of a renal cancer patient and exposed in vitro to renal tumor-associated antigens (TAA).  Introducing these renal tumor-reactive autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes back to the same patient target tumor cells expressing these TAAs and could induce a cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response against renal cell cancer.</Description>
