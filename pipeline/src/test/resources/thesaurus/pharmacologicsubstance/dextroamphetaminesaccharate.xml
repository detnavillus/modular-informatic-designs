<Description>The saccharate salt form of the dextro-isomer of amphetamine, a synthetic substance related to natural sympathomimetic amines, with CNS stimulating properties. Dextroamphetamine saccharate acts by facilitating the release of catecholamines, particularly noradrenaline and dopamine, from its storage sites in nerve terminals in the brain, and inhibits their uptake within the mesocorticolimbic system, a major component of the brain reward system, thereby resulting in measurable behavioral changes such as euphoria. As a CNS stimulant, this agent may increase blood pressure and reduce appetite. Similar to other amphetamines, dextroamphetamine has a high potential for abuse, dependence, and addiction if used in large doses over extended periods of time.</Description>
