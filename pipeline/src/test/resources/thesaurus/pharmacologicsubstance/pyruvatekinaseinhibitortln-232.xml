<Description>A synthetic cyclic heptapeptide with potential antineoplastic activity. Pyruvate kinase (PK) inhibitor TLN-232 targets pyruvate kinase M2 (M2PK), which may disrupt tumor cell anaerobic glycolysis. M2PK is a dimeric isoform of PK and the predominant PK isoform found in tumor cells</Description>
