<Description>A radiolabeled murine monoclonal antibody (also known as T101) directed against T65, an antigen found on cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells as well as normal T lymphocytes. T101 labeled with 131I, 125I, or 111In has potential use in the radioimaging of CTCL.  M A radiolabeled T101 human T-lymph may induce a cytotoxic T-cell response against T65-expressing T cells.
