<Description>An orally bioavailable antagonist of human insulin-like growth factor type I receptor (IGF-1R) with potential antineoplastic activity. IGF-1R antagonist BMS-7548077 binds to IGF-1R, preventing IGF-1 ligand binding and activation of IGF-1R-mediated signaling pathways; inhibition of IGF-1R-mediated signaling pathways may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. IGF-1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on most tumor cells and is involved in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor cell survival.</Description>
