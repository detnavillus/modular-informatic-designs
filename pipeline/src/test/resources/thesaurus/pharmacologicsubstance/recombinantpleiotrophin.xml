<Description>A recombinant form of the heparin-binding cytokine pleiotrophin.  Developmentally regulated, pleiotrophin functions as a growth factor during embryogenesis and the neonatal period, contributing to trophoblast formation, organ development, bone formation, and early brain development by inducing the differentiation and proliferation of neuronal tissue.  Expressed in certain tumor cell types, this agent may stimulate tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. (NCI04)</Description>
