<Description>An admixture of recombinant vaccinia virus encoding MUC-1 and recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the murine T-cell co-stimulatory molecule B7.1.  MUC-1 is a glycosylated mucin that is overexpressed in breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, stomach, colon, and ovarian carcinomas.  Vaccination with MUC-1 in combination with B7.1 may enhance the cytotoxic T cell (CTL) immune response to tumors expressing MUC-1, compared to vaccination with MUC-1 alone. (NCI04)</Description>
