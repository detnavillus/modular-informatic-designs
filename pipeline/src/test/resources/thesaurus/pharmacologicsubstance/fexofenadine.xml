<Description>The hydrochloride salt form of fexofenadine, a carboxylated metabolic derivative of terfenadine and third generation selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist with antihistaminic and non-sedative effects. Fexofenadine competitively binds peripheral H1-receptors, thereby stabilizing an inactive conformation of the receptor. Consequently histamine binding and activity as a result of mast-cell degranulation followed by the release of multiple inflammatory mediators, such as interleukins, prostaglandin and leukotriene precursors, is blocked, thereby preventing the triggering of pro-inflammatory pathways.</Description>
<Description>A second generation, long-lasting selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist with antiinflammatory property. Fexofenadine is a highly selective and reversible competitor at peripheral H1 histamine receptors in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle. This agent interferes with mediators release from mast cells either by inhibiting calcium ion influx across mast cell/basophil plasma membrane or by inhibiting intracellular calcium ion release within the cells. In addition fexofenadine may also inhibit the late-phase allergic reaction by acting on leukotrienes or prostaglandins, or by producing an anti-platelet activating factor effect. Overall, this agent blocks the actions of endogenous histamine, thereby leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms associated with histamine and achieve effects such as decreased vascular permeability, reduction of pruritus and localized smooth muscle relaxation.</Description>
