<Description>A recombinant fowlpox virus-based vaccine vector designed to express various tumor-associated peptide antigens. Strong CD8 cytotoxic T cell responses may be induced after prolonged immunization with fowlpox virus vaccines and have been associated with tumor regression. Fowlpox virus is an attractive vector because its genome is easy to manipulate and it does not multiply in human tissues. (NCI05)</Description>
