<Description>The carbonate salt of lithium, a soft alkali metal, with antimanic and hematopoietic activities. Lithium interferes with transmembrane sodium exchange in nerve cells by affecting sodium, potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+, K+-ATPase); alters the release of neurotransmitters; affects cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations; and blocks inositol metabolism resulting in depletion of cellular inositol and inhibition of phospholipase C-mediated signal transduction. The exact mechanism through which lithium exerts its mood-stabilizing effect has not been established. In addition, lithium stimulates granulocytopoiesis and appears to increase the level of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells by stimulating the release of hematopoietic cytokines and/or directly acting on hematopoietic stem cells.</Description>
<Description>The citrate salt of lithium, a monovalent cation with antimanic activity. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, lithium might exert its mood-stabilizing effect via reduction of catecholamine concentration mediated through transneuronal membrane transport of sodium ion by sodium-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase). Alternatively, lithium may decrease cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, which would desensitize hormonal-sensitive adenylyl cyclase receptors. Furthermore, lithium, in recommended dosage, blocks the activity of inositol-1-phosphatase, thereby resulting in the subsequent decrease of postsynaptic second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate, that contribute to chronic cell stimulation by altering electrical activity in the neuron.</Description>
<Description>A salt of lithium that has been used experimentally as an immunomodulator.</Description>
<Description>An element in the alkali metals family. It has the atomic symbol Li, atomic number 3, and atomic weight 6.94. Salts of lithium are used in treating BIPOLAR DISORDER.</Description>
<Description>A lithium salt, classified as a mood-stabilizing agent. Lithium ion alters the metabolism of BIOGENIC MONOAMINES in the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, and affects multiple neurotransmission systems.</Description>
<Description>A monovalent cation that is metabolized much like sodium and is important in many cellular functions inside or on the surface of cells.</Description>
