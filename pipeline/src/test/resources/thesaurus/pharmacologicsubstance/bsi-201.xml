<Description>A small molecule prodrug and a novel inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with potential antineoplastic activity. BSI-201 selectively targets and binds to PARP, which catalyzes post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins and can be activated by single strand breaks in DNA. By preventing DNA repair mediated through the blockade of PARP activity, BSI-201 enhances the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverses tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</Description>
