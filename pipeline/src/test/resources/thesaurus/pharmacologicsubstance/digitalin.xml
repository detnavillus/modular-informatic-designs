<Description>A glycoside compound, extracted from the leaves and seeds of the common foxglove, with anti-arrhythmic property. Digitalin inhibits the enzymatic activity of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in cardiac tissue, thereby increasing intracellular sodium and calcium levels and providing a positive inotropic effect. This results in increased force of myocardial muscle contraction. This agent also has a vagal effect on the parasympathetic nervous system, and as such slows the ventricular heart rate as well as helps eliminate fluid from body tissues.</Description>
