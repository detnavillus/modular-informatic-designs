<Description>An anti-aphthous ulcer drug. Amlexanox inhibits the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators, including leukotrienes and histamine, from mast cells, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells. Amlexanox also acts as a leukotriene D4 antagonist and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Amlexanox decreases the time ulcers take to heal as well as the pain associated with the ulcers.</Description>
