<Description>Any commercial combination preparation, by Novartis, containing the decongestant pseudoephedrine hydrochloride used to relieve symptoms of cold and flu. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, a sympathomimetic agent, stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors and causes vasoconstriction. This reduces blood flow, decreases swelling and prevents nasal and sinus congestion.</Description>
