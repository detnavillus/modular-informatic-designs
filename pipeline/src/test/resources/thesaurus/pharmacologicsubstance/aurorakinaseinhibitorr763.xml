<Description>A water-soluble, synthetic small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. R763 selectively binds to and inhibits aurora kinases (AKs), a family of serine-threonine kinases that are important regulators of cell division and proliferation, and are overexpressed in certain types of cancer. Inhibition of aurora kinases inhibits cell division and proliferation, as well as induces apoptosis in tumor cells overexpressing AKs.</Description>
