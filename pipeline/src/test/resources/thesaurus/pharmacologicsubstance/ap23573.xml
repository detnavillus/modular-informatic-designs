<Description>A small molecule and non-prodrug analog of rapamycin with potent antitumor activity. AP23573 binds to and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase that is upregulated in some tumors and plays an important role downstream of the phosphatidylinositol (PI3K)/Akt (protein kinase B) signaling pathway. Inhibition of mTOR by AP23573 may lead to cell cycle arrest, and consequently blocks tumor cell growth and proliferation.</Description>
