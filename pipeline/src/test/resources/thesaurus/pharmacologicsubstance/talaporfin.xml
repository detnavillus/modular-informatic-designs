<Description>An agent consisting of chlorin e6, derived from chlorophyll, and L-aspartic acid with photosensitizing activity.  After intratumoral activation by light emitting diodes, taporfin sodium forms an extended high energy conformational state that generates singlet oxygen, resulting in free radical-mediated cell death.
