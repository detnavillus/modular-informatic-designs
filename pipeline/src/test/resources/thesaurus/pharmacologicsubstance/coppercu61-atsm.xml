<Description>A lipophilic copper(II)bis(thiosemicarbazone) labeled with the positron-emitting isotope (61)Cu with hypoxia-selective and radioisotopic activities. With a high membrane permeability and redox potential, (61)Cu-ATSM easily enters and selectively resides in hypoxic cells. The extent of (61)Cu-ATSM retention in tissue is inversely related to the state of tissue oxygenation allowing the quantitation of tissue hypoxia with positron emission tomography (PET).</Description>
