<Description>A pro-inflammatory delta chemokine with potential antineoplastic activity.  Fractalkine induces the adhesion and migration of T lymphocytes, monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells.  In lymphomas, this agent may promote cell-mediated lympholysis by recruiting activated NK cells. (NCI04)</Description>
