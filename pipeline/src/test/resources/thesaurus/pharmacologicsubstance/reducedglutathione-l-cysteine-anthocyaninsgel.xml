<Description>A gel formulation containing reduced glutathione, L-cysteine, and anthocyanins with potential antioxidant, immunostimulating, and chemoprotective properties. Reduced glutathione is the primary cellular antioxidant and plays important roles in the antioxidation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals and, as a thiol-containing co-enzyme, in the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds. In addition, glutathione affects DNA synthesis and repair and exerts immunostimulating activity by increasing the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), promoting antigen presentation, and stimulating T-suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8 cells) cells. The flavonoid anthocyanins, derived from various blue and purple flowering plants, are potent scavengers of reactive oxygen species.</Description>
