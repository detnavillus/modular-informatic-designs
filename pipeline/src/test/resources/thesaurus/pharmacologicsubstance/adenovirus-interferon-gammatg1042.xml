<Description>A replication-defective adenoviral vector encoding human interferon-gamma (IFN-g) cDNA with potential antineoplastic and immunoregulatory activities. Upon intratumoral administration, the prolonged expression of IFN-g by adenovirus-interferon-gamma TG1042 promotes a T helper type 1 (Th1-type) immune response and inhibits the Th2-mediated cytokine production observed in many cutaneous lymphomas. IFN-g also mediates interleukin-12 (IL-12) production by antigen-presenting cells (APCs); activates macrophages, cytotoxic T-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells; upregulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules; and stimulates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Altogether, these IFN-g-mediated effects may result in an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and tumor cell death.</Description>
