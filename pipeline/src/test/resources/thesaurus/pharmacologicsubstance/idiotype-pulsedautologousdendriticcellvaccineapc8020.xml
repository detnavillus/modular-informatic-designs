<Description>A cell-based cancer vaccine composed of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with tumor-derived clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, idiotype-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine APC8020, containing idiotype (Id) protein structures that can be recognized by antibodies and by CD41 T lymphocytes and CD81 T lymphocytes, may stimulate antitumoral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and antibody responses against Id-expressing tumor cells. The Id represents the unique antigenic determinants in the variable regions of the clonal Ig.</Description>
