<Description>A retinobenzoic acid with potential antineoplastic activity.  TAC-101 inhibits retinoblastoma-gene product (RB) phosphorylation and increases the presence of 2 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, resulting in cell cycle arrest.  This agent also causes a cytotoxic decline in cyclin A and thymidylate synthase expression. (NCI04)</Description>
