<Synonym>Obatoclax Mesylate</Synonym>
<Description>The mesylate salt form of obatoclax, a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of the bcl-2 family of proteins with potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities. Obatoclax binds to members of the Bcl-2 family (bcl-2, bcl-xl, bcl-w, and Mcl-1), thereby preventing the binding of these anti-apoptotic proteins to their effectors Bax and Bak, pro-apoptotic proteins. This restores the activation of Bax and Bak, thereby reactivating the apoptotic pathway in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells. The Bcl-2 family proteins are overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers, including those of the lymph, breast, lung, prostate, and colon.</Description>
