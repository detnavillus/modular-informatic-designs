<Description>An ointment formulation of the hydrochloride salt of an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor with hair-growth inhibitory and potential chemopreventive activities. When administered topically, eflornithine irreversibly inhibits skin ODC activity, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of polyamines; inhibition of polyamine synthesis may result in diminished hair growth and epidermal cell turnover.</Description>
