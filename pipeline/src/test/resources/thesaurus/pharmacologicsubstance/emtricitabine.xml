<Description>A synthetic nucleoside analogue of cytidine with activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Emtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 RT by competing with the RT natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA which results in the termination of viral DNA chain elongation.</Description>
