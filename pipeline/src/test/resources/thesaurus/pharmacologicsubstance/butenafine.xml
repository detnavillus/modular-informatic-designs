<Description>The hydrochloride salt form of butenafine, a synthetic benzylamine derivative with fungicidal properties. Butenafine hydrochloride interferes with the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an important component of fungal cell membranes, by inhibiting the epoxidation of squalene. This alters fungal membrane permeability and causes growth inhibition. Butenafine hydrochloride is active against a number of dermatophytes, including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Sporothrix schenckii, and yeasts, including Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis.</Description>
