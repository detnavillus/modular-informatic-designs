<Description>A synthetic, triterpenoid compound with anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. CDDO blocks the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2), two enzymes involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis. This agent also inhibits the interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory proteins matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and the expression of Bcl-3, an IL-1-responsive gene that preferentially contributes to MMP-1 gene expression.</Description>
