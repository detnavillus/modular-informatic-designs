<Description>The chloride salt form of thallium-201, a cyclotron produced isotope use in diagnostic imaging. Thallous chloride TI-201 accumulates in myocardial cells and other tissues in an analogous way as potassium, and can be evaluated as a function of blood flow. By scintigraphic means, areas with decreased blood flow, consisting of ischemic cells, can be visualized due to decreased uptake of TI-201 in contrast to areas with normal blood flow.</Description>
