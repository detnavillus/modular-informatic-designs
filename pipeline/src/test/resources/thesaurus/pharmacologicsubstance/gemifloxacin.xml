<Description>A fluoroquinolone antibiotic with antimicrobial property. Gemifloxacin enters bacterial cells by diffusion through integral membrane porin pathway before targeting both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, two enzymes critical for DNA replication and repair. This agent binds to the DNA/DNA-gyrase complex and inhibits the A subunits of the enzyme thereby preventing the bacterial chromosome from rejoining. This interferes with DNA replication and repair processes as well as transcription, and ultimately leads to bacterial cell death. Gemifloxacin targets at both Gram-positive, -negative and atypical human pathogens.</Description>
<Description>The mesylate salt form of gemifloxacin, a synthetic broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity. Gemifloxacin mesylate inhibits activities of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and eventually bacterial growth. This fluoroquinolone exerts an enhanced spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to its activity against gram-negative bacteria.</Description>
