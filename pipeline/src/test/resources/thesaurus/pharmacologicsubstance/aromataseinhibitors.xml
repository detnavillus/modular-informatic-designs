<Description>Compounds that inhibit AROMATASE in order to reduce production of estrogenic steroid hormones.</Description>
<Description>An agent that blocks the function of the enzyme aromatase with antineoplastic activity.  Aromatase inhibitors belong to two classes: Type I steroidal drugs are androgen substrate analogues that bind competitively but irreversibly to the enzyme.  Type II nonsteroidal inhibitors fit into the substrate binding site and bind reversibly to the enzyme.  Present in many tissues, aromatases are heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the adrenal conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and the peripheral conversion (aromatization) of androgenic precursors to estrogens.
