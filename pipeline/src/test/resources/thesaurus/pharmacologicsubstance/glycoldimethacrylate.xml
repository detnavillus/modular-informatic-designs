<Description>An organic chemical and ester of methacrylic acid. Glycol dimethacrylate is a reactive resin used as a functional monomer and a crosslinking agent in polymer production. Via photopolymerization, this agent is a component of hydrogels, which are used in applications such as scaffolds for tissue engineering or drug delivery carriers. In turn, hydrogel products can be applied to the prevention of thrombosis, post-operative adhesion formations, and as coatings for biosensors.</Description>
