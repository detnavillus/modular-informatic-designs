<Description>A small molecule and a pan-inhibitor of Bcl-2 family proteins, with pro-apoptotic activity. GX015-070 is a selective antagonist of the BH3-binding groove of the Bcl-2 family proteins, which are frequently overexpressed in cancers including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This agent induces/restores apoptosis in cancer cells by inhibiting apoptosis suppressors in multiple members of the Bcl-2 family simultaneously.</Description>
