<Description>A synthetic benzamide with antiprotozoal activity. Nitazoxanide exerts its antiprotozoal activity by interfering with the pyruvate ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase dependent electron transfer reaction, which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. PFOR enzyme reduces nitazoxanide, thereby impairing the energy metabolism. However, interference with the PFOR enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction may not be the only pathway by which nitazoxanide exhibits antiprotozoal activity. Nitazoxanide is active against Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum.</Description>
