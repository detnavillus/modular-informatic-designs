<Description>A synthetic long-acting polymer derivative of the female sex hormone estradiol.  As the primary, most potent estrogen hormone produced by the ovaries, estradiol binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors.  Estradiol exhibits mild anabolic and metabolic properties, and increases blood coagulability.  Administration of polyestradiol phosphate leads to the marked decrease of testosterone levels and may exhibit a bone mass-preserving effect in patients with prostatic cancer. (NCI04)</Description>
