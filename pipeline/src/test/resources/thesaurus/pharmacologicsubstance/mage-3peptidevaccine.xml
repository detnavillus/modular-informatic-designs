<Description>A cancer vaccine consisting of a peptide derived from MAGE-3 and the pan-DR epitope (PADRE), an immunostimulant.  Vaccination with CY-2010 may elicit a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune response against tumor cells expressing MAGE-3. MAGE-is an antigen found on many tumor cell types, including melanoma and lung, prostate, colon, thyroid, and breast cancers. (NCI04)</Description>
