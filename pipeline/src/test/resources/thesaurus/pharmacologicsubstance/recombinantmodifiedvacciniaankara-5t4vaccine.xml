<Description>A cancer vaccine comprised of a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral vector encoding the 5T4 fetal oncoprotein (MVA-h5T4). Vaccination with recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara-5T4 vaccine may stimulate the host immune system to mount a humoral and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against tumor cells expressing 5T4 fetal oncoprotein antigen, resulting in tumor cell lysis. The MVA viral vector, derived from the replication-competent strain Ankara, is a highly attenuated, replication-defective vaccinia strain incapable of virion assembly.</Description>
