<Description>A potent orally available inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases with potential antineoplastic activity. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBF 1120 selectively inhibits the activity of several tyrosine kinase receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). This prevents tumor vascularization and tumor cell proliferation, eventually leading to tumor cell death. In addition, this agent inhibits members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, including Src, Lck, and Lyn, thereby further preventing tumor cell proliferation.</Description>
