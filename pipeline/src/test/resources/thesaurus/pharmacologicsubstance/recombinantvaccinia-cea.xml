<Description>A recombinant vaccinia virus encoding carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA is overexpressed in several cancer cell types, including gastrointestinal, breast, and non-small cell lung cancers. Attenuated vaccinia virus is a highly effective immunizing agent that evokes both humoral and cell-mediated responses.  Vaccination with this agent may evoke a cytotoxic immune response to CEA-expressing cells. (NCI04)</Description>
