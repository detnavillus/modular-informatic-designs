<Description>A radiofluorinated 2-nitroimidazole derivate with hypoxia-specific tracer activity. Misonidazole is reduced under hypoxic conditions and in reduced form covalently binds to macromolecules in hypoxic cells. 18F (fluorine-18) radiofluorination of misonidazole to form 18F-fluoromisonidazole allows radioisotopic imaging of reduced misonidazole bound to macromolecules in hypoxic cells.</Description>
