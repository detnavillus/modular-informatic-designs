<Description>A non-essential amino acid and dextro isomer of serine with antipsychotic activity. D-serine is a selective full agonist at the glycine site of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor. Hypofunction of NMDA type of neurotransmission is believed to play a major role in pathophysiology of schizophrenia, therefore, administration of D-serine and subsequent activation of NMDA receptors may alleviate psychotic tendencies.</Description>
