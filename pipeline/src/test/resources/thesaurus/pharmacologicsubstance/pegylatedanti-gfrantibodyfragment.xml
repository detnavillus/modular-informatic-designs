<Description>A pegylated, cross-linked, humanized divalent-Fab' antibody fragment directed against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) with potential antiangiogenic and antitumor activities. Pegylated anti-GFR antibody fragment binds to and inhibits VEGFR-2, which may inhibit angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Multivalent Fab' antibody fragments may exhibit improved retention and internalization properties compared to their parent IgGs.</Description>
