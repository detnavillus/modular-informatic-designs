<Description>An antimetabolite analogue of purine with antineoplastic and immuno-suppressant properties.  9H-Purine-6Thio-98D substitutes for the normal nucleoside and fraudulently incorporates into DNA and inhibits de novo purine synthesis, thereby inducing cell death. In vivo, this agent, also known as 6MP-arabinoside, may occur as a metabolite of the antineoplastic agent mercaptopurine. (NCI04)</Description>
