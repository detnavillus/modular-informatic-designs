<Description>The hydrochloride salt form of proparacaine, a benzoic acid derivative with local anesthetic property. Proparacaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby inhibiting sodium ion influx required for the initiation and conduction of impulses within the neuronal cell, and resulting in a loss of sensation.</Description>
