<Description>An orally active inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor family with potential antineoplastic activity. ARRY-334543 selectively and reversibly binds to both EGFR (ErbB-1) and Her-2/neu (ErbB-2), thereby preventing the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER-2/neu. This in turn inhibits the activation of various signal transduction pathways, leading to an inhibition of cellular growth and eventually to cell death. EGFR and Her-2 play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation and are upregulated in various human tumor cell types. Due to the dual inhibition of both EGFR and Her-2, ARRY-334543 might be therapeutically more efficient compared to current therapies that inhibit either EGFR or Her-2 alone.</Description>
