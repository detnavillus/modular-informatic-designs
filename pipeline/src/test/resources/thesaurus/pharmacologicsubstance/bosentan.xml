<Description>A sulfonamide-derived, competitive and specific endothelin receptor antagonist with a slightly higher affinity for the endothelin A receptor than endothelin B receptor. Bosentan blocks the action of endothelin 1, an extremely potent endogenous vasoconstrictor and bronchoconstrictor, by binding to endothelin A and endothelin B receptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. Bosentan decreases both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and is particularly used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.</Description>
