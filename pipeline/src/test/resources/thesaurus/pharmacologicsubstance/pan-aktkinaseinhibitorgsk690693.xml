<Description>An aminofurazan-derived inhibitor of Akt kinases with potential antineoplastic activity. Pan-AKT kinase inhibitor GSK-690693 binds to and inhibits Akt kinases 1, 2, and 3, which may result in the inhibition of protein phosphorylation events downstream from Akt kinases in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and, subsequently, the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, this agent may inhibit other protein kinases including protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA). As serine/threonine protein kinases which are involved in a number of biological processes, AKT kinases promote cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis and are required for glucose transport.</Description>
