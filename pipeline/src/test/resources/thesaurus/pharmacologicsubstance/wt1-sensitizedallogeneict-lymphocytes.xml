<Description>A population of allogeneic T-cells sensitized with Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) antigen with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, WT1-sensitized T cells may bind to and lyse WT1-expressing tumor cells. WT1 antigen, a zinc finger DNA-binding protein acting as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the cellular or chromosomal context, is overexpressed in leukemic cells and in a vast number of nonhematological solid tumors.</Description>
