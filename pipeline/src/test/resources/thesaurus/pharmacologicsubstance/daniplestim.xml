<Description>A synthetic cytokine and interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor agonist with enhanced hematopoietic potency. Daniplestim exhibits 10- to 20-fold greater biological activity than recombinant human IL-3 in human hematopoietic cell proliferation and marrow colony-forming-unit assays. In contrast, this agent shows no significant increase in pro-inflammatory activity relative to native IL-3. The enhanced hematopoietic activity of daniplestim correlates with a 60-fold increase in IL-3 alpha-subunit binding affinity and 20-fold greater affinity for binding to alpha/beta receptor complexes on intact cells relative to recombinant IL-3.</Description>
