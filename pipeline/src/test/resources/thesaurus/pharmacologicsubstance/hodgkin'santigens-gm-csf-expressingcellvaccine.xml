<Description>An allogeneic vaccine consisting of Hodgkin lymphoma cells transfected with the granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon vaccination, Hodgkin antigens-GM-CSF-expressing cell vaccine may stimulate a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response against Hodgkin lymphoma-associated antigens, which may result in the lysis of tumor cells expressing these antigens. In addition, transfected Hodgkin lymphoma cells secrete GM-CSF, which may potentiate the CTL response against Hodgkin lymphoma-associated antigens.</Description>
