<Description>A pyrazolobenzodiazepine small molecule with potential antiangiogenesis and antineoplastic activities. Mitosis-angiogenesis inhibitor (MAI) R1530 inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases involved in angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, -2, -3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) beta, FMS-like tyrosine kinase (Flt)-3, and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) -1, -2. In addition, this agents exhibits anti-proliferative activity by initiating mitotic arrest and inducing apoptosis.</Description>
