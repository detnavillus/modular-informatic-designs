<Description>A synthetic derivative of fumagillin with antineoplastic and cytotoxic properties.  PPI-2458 irreversibly inhibits the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (MetAP2), thereby preventing abnormal cell growth and angiogenesis. PPI-2458 is reported to have a better toxicity profile compared to other agents of its class. (NCI04)</Description>
