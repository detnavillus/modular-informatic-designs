<Description>The bromide salt form of methscopolamine, a quaternary ammonium derivative of scopolamine with anticholinergic properties. Methscopolamine bromide exerts its effect on muscarine receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby blocking the actions of acetylcholine. This leads to an inhibition of gastric secretions and gastrointestinal motility.</Description>
