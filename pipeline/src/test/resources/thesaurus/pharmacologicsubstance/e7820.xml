<Description>A small molecule and aromatic sulfonamide derivative with potential antiangiogenic and antitumor activities. E7820 inhibits angiogenesis by suppressing integrin alpha 2, a cell adhesion molecule expressed on endothelial cells. Inhibition of integrin alpha 2 leads to an inhibition of cell-cell interactions, endothelial cell-matrix interactions, vascular endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.</Description>
