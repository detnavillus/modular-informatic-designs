<Description>A synthetic lipid second messenger.  As an analog of the second messenger diacylglycerol, sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol substitutes for diacylglycerol in the cascade of calcium and phospholipid dependent PKC activation.  Topical application of this agent results in a striking inflammatory response characterized by edema, extensive epidermal infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, intraepidermal microabscesses. sn-1,2-Didecanoylglycerol is used as a tumor promoter in experimental animal models of skin cancer due to its stimulation of epidermal protein kinase C activity.
