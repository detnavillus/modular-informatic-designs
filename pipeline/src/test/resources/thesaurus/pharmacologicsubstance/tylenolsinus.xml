<Description>A commercial combination preparation, by Johnson and Johnson, containing acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride used to relieve symptoms of cold and flu. Acetaminophen exerts analgesic and antipyretic actions by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, a sympathomimetic agent, acts as a decongestant by inducing vasoconstriction mediated through alpha-adrenergic receptors, thereby reducing blood flow which decreases swelling and prevents and relieves nasal and sinus congestion.</Description>
