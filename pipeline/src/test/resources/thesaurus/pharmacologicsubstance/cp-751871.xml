<Description>A human monoclonal antibody directed against the insulin-like growth factor type I receptor (IGF1R) with potential antineoplastic activity. CP-751871 selectively binds to IGF1R, preventing insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF1) from binding to the receptor and subsequent receptor autophosphorylation. Inhibition of IGF1R autophosphorylation may result in a reduction in receptor expression on tumor cells that express IGF1R, a reduction in the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF, and inhibition of tumor growth. IGF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on most tumor cells and is involved in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor cell survival.</Description>
