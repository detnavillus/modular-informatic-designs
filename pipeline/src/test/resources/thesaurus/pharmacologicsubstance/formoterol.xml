<Description>A long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist with bronchodilator activity. Formoterol selectively binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, thereby activating intracellular adenyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, relieve bronchospasms, improve mucociliary clearance and reduce mediator substance release from inflammatory cells, especially from mast cells.</Description>
<Description>The fumarate salt form of formoterol, a long-acting and selective sympathomimetic beta-receptor agonist with bronchodilator activity. Formoterol fumarate binds beta 2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and stimulates intracellular adenyl cyclase, thereby increasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, improve mucociliary clearance and reduce mediator substance release in inflammatory cells, especially from mast cells.
