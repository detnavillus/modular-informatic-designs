<Description>A short-acting barbiturate derivative without hypnotic properties, Phetharbital (N-phenylbarbital) can be used as a sedative and anticonvulsant agent due to its mechanism of enhancing GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid) transmission and inhibition of synaptic excitation. Phetharbital has generally been withdrawn from clinical use. (NCI04)</Description>
