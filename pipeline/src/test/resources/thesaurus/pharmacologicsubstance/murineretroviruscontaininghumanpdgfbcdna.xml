<Synonym>Murine Retrovirus Containing Human PDGFB cDNA</Synonym>
<Description>A murine retrovirus that contains plasmid DNA (cDNA) coding for the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFB).  Overexpressed in some human brain tumors, PDGFB and PDGF receptors may stimulate tumor development in an autocrine manner.  A murine retrovirus containing human PDGFB cDNA may be used to induce brain tumors in animal models of brain tumorigenesis. (NCI04)</Description>
