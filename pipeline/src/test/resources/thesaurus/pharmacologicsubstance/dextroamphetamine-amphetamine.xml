<Description>A combination of two synthetic agents with central nervous system stimulant activity.  Both agents are non-catecholamine, sympathomimetic agents that elevate blood pressure and cause bronchodilation.  These agents are commonly abused psychostimulant drugs that induce psychologic dependence manifested by elevated mood, increased wakefulness, concentration, physical performance and a feeling of well-being.  Tolerance to various effects develops unequally, so that tachycardia and enhanced alertness diminish while psychotoxic effects (hallucinations and delusions) may occur. (NCI04)</Description>
