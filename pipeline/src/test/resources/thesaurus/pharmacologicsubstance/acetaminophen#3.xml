<Description>A synthetic p-aminophenol derivative combined with codeine, anti-inflammatory and analgesic Acetaminophen 3 is used against inflammatory conditions, fever, and pain. Codeine is an opium alkaloid with analgesic properties. The active principal metabolite of phenacetin, Acetaminophen appears to inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis in the central nervous system and less in peripheral tissues. Equipotent to acetylsalicylic acid, but more toxic, Acetaminophen may cause liver and kidney damage, especially in children. (NCI04)</Description>
