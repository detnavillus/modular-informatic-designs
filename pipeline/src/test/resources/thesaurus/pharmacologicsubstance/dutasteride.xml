<Description>A synthetic 4-azasteroid compound. Dutasteride competitively and specifically binds to isoenzymes 1 and 2 of 5 alpha-reductase, forming stable enzyme complexes and inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT); the reduction in DHT activity may mitigate or prevent enlargement of the prostate gland. The type 2 5 alpha-reductase isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues, while the type 1 isoenzyme is also active in skin and the liver.</Description>
