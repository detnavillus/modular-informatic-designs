<Description>A population of cells derived from adipose tissue with stem cell and wound repair activities. Adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) consists of several cell types several types, such as adult stem cells, vascular endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells, among others. These cells contribute to wound repair through a variety of mechanisms by promoting blood vessel growth and blocking apoptosis. In addition, ADRC can differentiate into several tissue types, such as bone, cartilage, fat, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle.</Description>
