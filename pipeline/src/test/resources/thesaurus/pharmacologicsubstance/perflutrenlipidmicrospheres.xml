<Description>An injectable suspension of liposome-encapsuled microspheres containing the fluorocarbon gas perflutren for contrast enhancement in ultrasound procedures. Because the acoustic impedance of perflutren lipid microspheres is much lower than that of blood, impinging ultrasound waves are scattered and reflected at the microsphere-blood interface and may be visualized with ultrasound imaging.</Description>
