<Description>A vitamin D3 analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Seocalcitol binds to and activates the vitamin D receptor, a cytoplasmic polypeptide expressed in normal vitamin D responsive tissues, but also overexpressed in certain cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Mediated through vitamin D receptor, this agent induces cancer cell differentiation, inhibits cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis. In addition, seocalcitol may also induce growth arrest and apoptosis independent of vitamin D receptor activation through mechanisms that are not fully elucidated.</Description>
