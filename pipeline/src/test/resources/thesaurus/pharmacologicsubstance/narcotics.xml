<Description>Agents that induce NARCOSIS. This term is considered outdated due to imprecision but continues to be widely used. Originally, agents that caused somnolence or induced sleep (STUPOR); now, any derivative, natural or synthetic, of OPIUM or MORPHINE or any substance that has their effects. Narcotics are potent inducers of ANALGESIA and OPIOID-RELATED DISORDERS.</Description>
