<Description>An orally bioavailable synthetic P2 threonine boronic acid inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, with potential antineoplastic activity. Proteasome inhibitor CEP 18770 represses the proteasomal degradation of a variety of proteins specifically IkappaBalpha, an intracellular protein that functions as a primary inhibitor of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB. This results in the cytoplasmic sequestration of transcription factor NF-kappaB and inhibits its nuclear translocation and transcriptional up-regulation of a variety of cell growth-promoting factors; exposure to this agent may result in apoptotic cell death in susceptible tumor cell populations.</Description>
