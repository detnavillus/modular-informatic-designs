<Description>An immunoconjugate that consists of a humanized monoclonal antibody (MLN591), directed against prostate-specific membrane antigen linked to a maytansinoid (DM1). The monoclonal antibody moiety of MLN2704 binds to tumor cells expressing prostate-specific membrane antigen; MLN274 is then internalized into the tumor cell where the DM1 maytansinoid moiety binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization and microtubule assembly, resulting in a disruption of microtubule activity and cell division, and cell death.
