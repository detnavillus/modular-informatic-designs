<Description>An alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist that acts by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscle of blood vessels (arteries, arterioles and veins), gastrointestinal tract, and radial smooth muscle of the iris. This prevents smooth muscle contraction and results in vasodilatation. Administered in the eye, dapiprazole hydrochloride produces miosis. In the heart, it may antagonize alpha-1 adrenoreceptors in myocytes causing a mild negative inotropic effect.</Description>
