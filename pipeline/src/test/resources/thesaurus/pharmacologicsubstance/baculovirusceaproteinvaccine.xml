<Description>A vaccine consisting of recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) produced by a baculovirus expression system with potential antineoplastic activity. Vaccination with baculovirus CEA protein vaccine may stimulate the host immune system to mount a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against CEA positive cells, resulting in decreased tumor growth.  CEA is overexpressed in several cancer cell types, including gastrointestinal, breast, and non-small cell lung cancers. (NCI04)</Description>
