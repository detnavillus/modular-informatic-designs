<Description>A nanoparticle albumin-bound formulation of the taxane docetaxel with antineoplastic activity. Docetaxel is a semi-synthetic, second-generation taxane derived from a compound found in the European yew tree Taxus baccata. Docetaxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death. This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response. This nanoparticle albumin-bound formulation solubilizes docetaxel without the use of the nonionic solubilizer Cremophor ELP, permitting the administration of larger doses of docetaxel while avoiding Cremophor ELP-associated toxicity.</Description>
