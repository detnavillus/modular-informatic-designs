<Description>A toyl compound with anti-asthmatic property. Zafirlukast selectively and competitively binds and blocks the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor , thereby preventing potent proinflammatory mediators leukotriene C4, D4 and E4 from binding. This prevents leukotriene-mediated actions, including enhanced migration of eosinophils and neutrophils, increased adhesion of leukocytes, increased monocyte and neutrophil aggregation, increased airway edema, inflammation, capillary permeability and bronchoconstriction.</Description>
