<Description>An orally bioavailable anti-inflammatory agent with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. COX-2 inhibitor TG01 binds to and inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), thereby inhibiting the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. TG01-mediated inhibition of COX-2 may induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. COX-related metabolic pathways may represent crucial regulators of cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.</Description>
