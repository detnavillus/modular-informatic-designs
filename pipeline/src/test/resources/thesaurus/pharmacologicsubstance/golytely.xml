<Description>A commercial combination preparation, by Braintree Laboratories, containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and the electrolytes sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and potassium chloride in isosmotic solution with laxative activity. GoLytely attracts water to the bowel, thereby softening the stool, inducing diarrhea and increasing bowel movement. The osmotic activity of PEG and electrolytes causes no net absorption or excretion of water and electrolytes. This laxative is used to clean the colon before certain tests or surgery of the rectum and colon.</Description>
