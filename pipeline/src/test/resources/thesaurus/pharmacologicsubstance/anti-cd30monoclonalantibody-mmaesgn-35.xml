<Description>An auristatin immunoconjugate targeting the tumor necrosis factor receptor CD30 antigen, with potential antineoplastic activity. SGN-35 is generated by conjugating the humanized anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody SGN-30, via a valine-citrulline peptide linker, to a cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). SGN-35 delivers MMAE to cells expressing CD30 receptors, which are transient during lymphocyte activation but constitutively expressed in hematologic malignancies including Hodgkin's disease and some T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Upon internalization, and after enzymatic cleavage, MMAE is released into the cytosol, where it binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization, thereby leading to G2/M phase arrest and inducing apoptosis. The linkage system is highly stable in plasma, making SGN-35 cytotoxicity specific for CD30 antigen positive cells.</Description>
