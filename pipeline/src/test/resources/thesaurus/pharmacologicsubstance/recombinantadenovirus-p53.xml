<Description>A genetically-engineered adenovirus that contains the gene that encodes the human tumor-suppressor protein p53 with potential antineoplastic activity. Recombinant adenovirus-p53 SCH-58500 delivers p53 into tumor cells, which may result in p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</Description>
