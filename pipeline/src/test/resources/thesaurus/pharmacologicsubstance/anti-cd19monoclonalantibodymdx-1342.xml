<Description>A fully human anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody directed against the B-cell-specific membrane protein CD-19 with potential antineoplastic activity. Anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MDX-1342 binds to CD19, depleting and eliminating CD19-expressing B-cells. CD19 is widely expressed during B-cell development, from pro-B-cell to early plasma cell stages.</Description>
