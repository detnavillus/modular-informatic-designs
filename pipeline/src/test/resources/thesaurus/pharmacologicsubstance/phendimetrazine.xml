<Description>A phenylalkylamine sympathomimetic amine with appetite depressant property. Phendimetrazine tartrate is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the active metabolite phenmetrazine, which competes with norepinephrine and dopamine for their presynaptic transporters, thereby blocks the reuptake of these monoamines at the neuronal junctions. As a result, this prolongs activities of dopamine and norepinephrine and leads to central nervous system (CNS) stimulation and metabolic effects, including appetite-suppression, decreased gastric acid secretion and increased blood pressure.</Description>
