<Description>Any of the commercial combination preparations, by Novartis, containing the antihistamine chlorpheniramine maleate and the decongestant pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, either alone or in combination with the analgesic antipyretic acetaminophen and/or the antitussive dextromethorphan hydrobromide. Chlorpheniramine maleate, an antihistamine, blocks the effects of histamine, thereby preventing symptoms such as sneezing and itchy, watery eyes, runny nose and sore throat. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, a sympathomimetic agent, acts as a decongestant by inducing vasoconstriction mediated via alpha-adrenergic receptors. This reduces blood flow, decreases swelling and prevents nasal and sinus congestion.</Description>
