<Description>A liposome-encapsulated formulation of paclitaxel, a taxoid compound extracted from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia, with antineoplastic property. Paclitaxel binds to tubulin and interferes with the assembly/disassembly dynamics of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell division. This agent also induces apoptosis via inactivation of the apoptosis inhibitor, B-cell Leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) protein. Paclitaxel liposome formulation potentially enhances delivery of higher doses of paclitaxel to the target tissues and exhibits lower systemic toxicity.</Description>
