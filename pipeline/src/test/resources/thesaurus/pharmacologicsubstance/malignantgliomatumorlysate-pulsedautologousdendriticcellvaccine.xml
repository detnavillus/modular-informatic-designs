<Synonym>Malignant Glioma Tumor Lysate-Pulsed Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine</Synonym>
<Description>A cell-based cancer vaccine composed of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with lysates from malignant glioma cells with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine exposes the immune system to undefined malignant glioma tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which may result in anti-tumoral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and antibody responses against glioma cells and glioma cell lysis.</Description>
