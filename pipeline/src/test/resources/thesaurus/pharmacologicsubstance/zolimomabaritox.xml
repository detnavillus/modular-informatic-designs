<Description>An immunotoxin consisting of a murine anti-CD5 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the ricin A chain.  The anti-CD5 monoclonal antibody component binds to CD5, a T-cell associated antigen, thereby targeting the delivery of the cytotoxic ricin A chain to T-cells.  The ricin A chain component binds to T-cells and disrupts ribosomal activity and protein synthesis and induces cell cycle arrest. (NCI04)</Description>
