<Description>Wild Type and Mutant MGMT Vectors are genetic carrier vehicles containing an in vivo selection marker derived from natural or mutant O-6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and are used in gene therapy and biomedical research for selection of specific traits in targeted cells, such as genes that confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Mutant MGMTs resistant to the MGMT inactivator O-6-benzylguanine (BG) are potent markers for in vivo selection in irradiated and non-myelo ablated mouse models using BG plus alkylating agents to drive selection.
