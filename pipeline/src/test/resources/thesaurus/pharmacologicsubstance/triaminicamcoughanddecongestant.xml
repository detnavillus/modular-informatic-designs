<Description>A commercial combination preparation, by Novartis, containing dextromethorphan hydrobromide and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride used to relieve symptoms of cold and flu. Dextromethorphan exerts antitussive activity by raising the threshold for coughing in the cough center. Pseudoephedrine, a sympathomimetic agent, acts as a decongestant by inducing vasoconstriction mediated via alpha-adrenergic receptors. This reduces blood flow, decreases swelling and prevents nasal and sinus congestion.</Description>
