<Description>A synthetic form of the naturally occurring female sex hormone progesterone. Etonogestrel binds to the cytoplasmic progesterone receptors in the reproductive system and subsequently activates progesterone receptor mediated gene expression. As a result of the negative feedback mechanism, luteinizing hormone (LH) release is inhibited, which leads to an inhibition of ovulation and an alteration in the cervical mucus and endometrium.</Description>
