<Description>A synthetic triazolopyridine derivative, antidepressant and sedative Trazodone acts as a serotonin uptake inhibitor, chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, or other antidepressants. It is effective in patients with schizoaffective disorders; major depressive disorders; and depressive disorders associated with insomnia and anxiety. (NCI04)</Description>
<Description>The hydrochloride salt form of trazodone, a synthetic triazolopyridine derivative with antidepressant and sedative properties. Based on studies from animal models, trazodone selectively inhibits the re-uptake of serotonin by synaptosomes in the brain, thereby increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft and potentiating serotonin activity. Trazodone is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine-type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system. The sedative effect of trazodone is likely via alpha-adrenergic and mild histamine H1 blocking actions.</Description>
<Description>A serotonin uptake inhibitor that is used as an antidepressive agent. It has been shown to be effective in patients with major depressive disorders and other subsets of depressive disorders. It is generally more useful in depressive disorders associated with insomnia and anxiety. This drug does not aggravate psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders.
