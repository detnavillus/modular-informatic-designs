<Description>A synthetic derivative of L-arginine with antithrombotic activity. Argatroban is a univalent and direct inhibitor of fibrin-bound thrombin. This agent reversibly binds to the thrombin active site thereby preventing the thrombin-dependent reactions, which include conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin; the activation of factors V, VIII and XI; the activation of protein C; and platelet aggregation. Argatroban is highly selective for thrombin and is able to inhibit the action of both free and clot-associated thrombin. As a result, stabilization of blood clots and coagulation is inhibited.</Description>
