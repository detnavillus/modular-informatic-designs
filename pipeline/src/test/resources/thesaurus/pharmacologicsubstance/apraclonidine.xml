<Description>A clonidine derivative with selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonistic activity. Upon ocular administration, apraclonidine enhances aqueous humor uveoscleral outflow and decreases aqueous production by vasoconstriction. This may decrease intraocular pressure (IOP).</Description>
<Description>The hydrochloride salt form of apraclonidine, a clonidine derivative with selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonistic property. When administered directly to eyes, apraclonidine hydrochloride enhances aqueous humor outflow and decreases aqueous production by vasoconstriction. It is used mostly in ophthalmic preparations for decreasing intraocular pressure.</Description>
