<Description>A cruciferous vegetable extract with potential chemopreventive properties. Broccoli sprout extract contains a high amount of sulforaphane, a naturally occurring isothiocyanate. Sulforaphane activates transcription factor Nrf2, a member of the basic leucine zipper family, which binds to and activates antioxidant-response elements (AREs). Subsequently, activated AREs, cis-acting regulatory enhancer elements found in the 5' flanking region of many phase II detoxification enzymes, mediate the transcription of these enzymes (particularly glutathione-S-transferase and quinone oxidoreductase) resulting in the detoxification of highly reactive carcinogens.</Description>
