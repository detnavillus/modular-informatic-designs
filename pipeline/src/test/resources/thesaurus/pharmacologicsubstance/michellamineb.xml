<Description>A natural naphtylisoquinoline alkaloid with antiviral properties isolated from the tropical plant Ancistrocladus korupensis.  Michellamine B inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and HIV-induced cellular fusion and syncytium formation, thereby inhibiting the propagation of HIV types 1 and 2.  In addition, this agent inhibits human DNA polymerases alpha and beta.  Michellamine B is also a noncompetitive protein kinase C inhibitor and potent antioxidant. (NCI04)</Description>
