<Description>An oral calcimimetic. Cinacalcet hydrochloride increases the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptors on the chief cells in the parathyroid gland to extracellular calcium, thereby reducing parathyroid hormone secretion. A reduction in parathyroid hormone levels inhibits osteoclast activity, favourably impacts bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, bone turnover, and bone fibrosis, and leads to normalization of serum calcium and phosphate levels. Cinacalcet hydrochloride is a treatment option for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid carcinoma.</Description>
