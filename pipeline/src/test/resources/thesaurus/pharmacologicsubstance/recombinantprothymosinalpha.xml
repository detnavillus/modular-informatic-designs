<Description>A recombinant form of the endogenous polypeptide hormone that exerts immunomodulatory effects primarily on mononuclear cells.  Prothymosin alpha stimulates the production of various cytokines including granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) alpha, gamma interferon (IFN) and interleukins such as IL-2.  This agent may also increase some tumor antigens expression, thus inducing better T lymphocyte responses to tumor cells.  Combined with chemotherapy, prothymosin alpha may exhibit significant anti-tumor effects.  This agent also helps to regenerate lymph node and bone marrow cells after treatment with certain toxic chemotherapeutics. (NCI04)</Description>
