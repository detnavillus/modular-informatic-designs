<Description>A synthetic indanedione anticoagulant. Anisindione interferes with the vitamin K-dependent hepatic synthesis of active clotting factors by inhibiting the reduction of vitamin K. This leads to an inhibition of gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. The consequential effects of this inhibition include a reduced activity of these clotting factors and prolonged blood clotting time.</Description>
