<Description>An analog of thalidomide with potential antineoplastic activity that belongs to the functional class of agents called selective cytokine inhibitory drugs (SelCIDs).  SelCIDs inhibit phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE 4), an enzyme involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) production.  CC-1088 inhibits production of the cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (a pro-angiogenic factor) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). (NCI04)</Description>
