<Description>A Danish brand name for a laxative product containing glycerin and docusate sodium.  As a hyperosmotic laxative, glycerin draws water into the bowel from surrounding tissues, thereby softening the stool and increasing bowel action.  Docusate sodium acts as a surface-active agent (emollient) that promotes the mixing of intestinal liquid and dry stool. (NCI04)</Description>
