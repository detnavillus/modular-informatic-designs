<Description>A benzopyran with potential antineoplastic activity.  CC-8490 acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), inhibiting the proliferation of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells.  This agent also inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of glioblastoma cells via a mechanism independent of estrogen receptor-related mechanisms. (NCI04)</Description>
