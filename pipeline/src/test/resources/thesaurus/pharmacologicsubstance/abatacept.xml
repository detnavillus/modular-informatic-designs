<Description>A human fusion protein with immunosuppressive activity.  It consists of the binding domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and human IgG1. CTLA4-Ig works by binding to CD80 and CD86 on antigen presenting cells, thereby blocking the engagement of CD28 on T-cells, a co-stimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation. This co-stimulatory blocker prevents T-cell activation, and proliferation, and subsequent cytokine production. This T-cell regulatory protein may be useful in treating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and may help prevent organ transplant rejection.</Description>
