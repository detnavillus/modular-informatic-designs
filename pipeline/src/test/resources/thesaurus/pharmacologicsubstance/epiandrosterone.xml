<Description>A dehydroepiandrosterone metabolite and a precursor of testosterone and estradiol with hypolipidemic and anabolic property. Epiandrosterone, a potential neurosteroid, appears to bind to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine-receptor complex (GABA-RC), acting as a negative non-competitive modulator of GABA-RC as well as signal through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. In addition this agent inhibits the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) thereby dilating blood vessels pre-contracted by partial depolarization. Also, epiandrosterone inhibits the synthesis of thromboxane A2 in activated platelets, reduces plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and tissue plasminogen activator antigen, increases serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 and increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate and nitric oxide synthesis. These effects may improve circulation in the microvasculature.</Description>
