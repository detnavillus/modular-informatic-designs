<Description>A synthetic benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, sedative and hypnotic properties. Quazepam and its major metabolite 2-oxoquazepam potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by binding to the benzodiazepine-1 recognition site (BZ-1) within the GABA-A receptor, located in the limbic, neocortical and mesencephalic reticular system. This increases the frequency of GABA-activated chloride channel opening events, allowing the flow of chloride ions into the neuron leading to membrane hyperpolarization and decreased neuronal excitability.</Description>
