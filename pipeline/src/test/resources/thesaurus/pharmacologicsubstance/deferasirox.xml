<Description>A synthetic, orally bioavailable, achiral, tridentate triazole derived from salicylic acid with iron-chelating activity. Deferasirox chelates iron at a 2:1 (ligand:iron) ratio. Because of its oral availability and long plasma half-life, this agent may be superior to desferrioxamine (desferal, DFO), which is orally inactive and has a short plasma half-life.</Description>
