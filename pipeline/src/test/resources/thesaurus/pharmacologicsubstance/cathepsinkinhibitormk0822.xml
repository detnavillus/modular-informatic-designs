<Description>An inhibitor of cathepsin K with potential anti-osteoporotic activity. MK0822 inhibits the enzymatic activity of cathepsin K, a tissue-specific cysteine protease that catalyzes degradation of bone matrix proteins, such as collagen I/II, elastin, and osteonectin, during bone resorption. As cathepsin K plays an important role in osteoclast function, administration of MK0822 may lead to a reduction in bone resorption, which may in turn slow down the osteoporosis process.</Description>
