<Description>Proteins synthesized as a single chain of ~150 kDa with 35% sequence identity to TETANUS TOXIN that is cleaved to a light and a heavy chain that are linked by a single disulfide bond. They have neuro-, entero-, and hemotoxic properties, are immunogenic, and include the most potent poisons known. The most commonly used apparently blocks release of ACETYLCHOLINE at cholinergic SYNAPSES.</Description>
