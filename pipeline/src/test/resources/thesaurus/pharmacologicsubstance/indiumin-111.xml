<Description>A radioactive salt that is used as a reagent in the preparation of indium 111-labeled radiopharmaceuticals. Indium 111-labeled radioconjugates are used as radioactive tracers in nuclear medicine that detect malignant lesions and inflammatory tissues probably due to an increased capillary permeability. Indium-111 chloride is particularly used in the radiolabeling of the monoclonal antibodies satumomab pendetide, 7E11-C5.3 (CYT-356), and ibritumomab tiuxetan. (NCI05)</Description>
