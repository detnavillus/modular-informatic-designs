<Description>A small aminothiazole molecule and cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. SNS-032 binds to and prevents the phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases, especially CDK2, 7, and 9 that regulate cell cycle progression. Inhibition of CDKs leads to cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis. As a result, this agent causes cytotoxicity and prevents further tumor cell growth.</Description>
