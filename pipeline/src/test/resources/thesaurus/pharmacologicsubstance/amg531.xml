<Synonym>Amgen Megakaryopoiesis Protein 2</Synonym>
<Description>A recombinant protein with megakaryopoiesis stimulating activity. AMG 531 mimics endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO), directly binding to and activating the platelet thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R, Mpl, or CD110 antigen), a cytokine receptor belonging to the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. Activation of TPO-R stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes, resulting in an increase in the production of blood platelets.</Description>
