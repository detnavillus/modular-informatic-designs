<Description>A derivative of rhodacyanine with potential antineoplastic activity.  FJ5002 inhibits telomerase by interfering with holoenzyme assembly and telomere interaction, thus leading to replication-dependent shortening of telomeres with a concurrent increase in aneuploid metaphases and apoptotic cells.  Telomerase is active in most tumors cells, but is quiescent in adjacent normal cells. (NCI04)</Description>
