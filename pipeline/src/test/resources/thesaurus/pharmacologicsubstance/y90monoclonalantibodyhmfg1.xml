<Description>A radioimmunoconjugate of humanized monoclonal antibody (MoAb) HMFG1 labeled with Yttrium 90 (Y-90). MoAb MFG1 was raised against Human Milk Fat Globules and reacts with an epitope (PDTR) in the protein core of MUC1 mucins, which are up-regulated in human breast and other carcinomas.Y-90 MoAb HMFG1 delivers beta particle emitting Y-90 radionuclide directly to tumor cells that express MUC1, thereby this agent may be used in radioimmunotherapy of cancers.</Description>
