<Description>A man-made radioactive element with atomic symbol Am, atomic number 95, and atomic weight 243.</Description>
<Description>Americium. A completely man-made radioactive actinide with atomic symbol Am, atomic number 95, and atomic weight 243. Its valence can range from +3 to +6. Because of its nonmagnetic ground state, it is an excellent superconductor. It is also used in bone mineral analysis and as a radiation source for radiotherapy.</Description>
