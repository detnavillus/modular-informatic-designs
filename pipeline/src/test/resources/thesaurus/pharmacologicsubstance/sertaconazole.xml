<Description>The nitrate salt form of sertaconazole, a synthetic imidazole derivative with antifungal property. Sertaconazole nitrate inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450 sterol C-14 alpha-demethylation, resulting in the accumulation of fungal 14 alpha-methyl sterols and the inhibition of ergosterol synthesis, an essential component of the cell membrane of fungi. This leads to a disruption of cell membrane permeability and leakage of adenine triphosphate (ATP) and other constituents from fugal cells.</Description>
