<Description>A propanediol compound with anticonvulsant and antiepileptic properties. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, Felbamate may be an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine-recognition site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ionophore complex, thereby blocking the effects of the excitatory amino acids, suppressing neuronal firing, and preventing seizure activity. Felbamate also has weak inhibitory effects on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor binding sites which may contribute to its inhibitory effect on neuronal excitatory.</Description>
