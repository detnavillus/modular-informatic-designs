<Description>The oxalate salt of escitalopram, a pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalane derivative citalopram, with antidepressant activity. As a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), escitalopram blocks the reuptake of serotonin by neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby potentiating CNS serotonergic activity.</Description>
<Description>The active S-stereoisomer of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram with antidepressant, anti-obsessive-compulsive and antibulimic properties. Escitalopram inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane of the presynaptic cell, thereby increasing levels of 5-HT within the synaptic cleft and enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT1A autoreceptors. Unlike other SSRIs, escitalopram appears to not only bind to a primary high-affinity site on the serotonin transporter protein but also to a secondary lower-affinity allosteric site that is considered to stabilize and prolong drug binding.</Description>
