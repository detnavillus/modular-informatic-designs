<Description>A vaccine formulation consisting of several types of human papillomavirus (HPV)-derived noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs) with potential immunoprophylactic activity. Upon administration, HPV L1 VLP vaccine V504 may generate humoral immunity against various HPV L1 major capsid proteins, thereby preventing cervical infection upon exposure to the associated HPV types. VLPs are composed of self-assembling L1 major capsid proteins or functional L1 major capsid protein derivatives.</Description>
