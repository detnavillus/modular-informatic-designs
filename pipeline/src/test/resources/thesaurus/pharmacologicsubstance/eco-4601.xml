<Synonym>ECO-4601</Synonym>
<Description>A potent inhibitor of the RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathway with potential antineoplastic activity. ECO-4601 binds to and inhibits Ras kinase, thereby preventing the phosphorylation and activation of proteins downstream of the Ras signal transduction pathway, including serine/threonine kinase RAF (BRAF) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK-2), that play a crucial role in regulating cell growth and survival. ECO-4601 also selectively binds to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (BZRP), a receptor highly expressed in certain cancer cells, thus inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in BZRP-expressing cells. In addition, ECO-4601 is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby reaching therapeutic concentrations in the brain.</Description>
