<Description>An organometallic compound and a derivative of the naturally occurring antibiotic aspergillic acid with antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-seborrheic effects. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, pyrithione zinc maybe entering the cell in its chelate from, dissociating in the cytoplasm and exerting its anti-proliferative effect possibly through interaction with DNA. Alternatively, pyrithione might act by chelating metal cofactors of enzymes through its sulfhydryl group. Pyrithione has also been shown to interfere with thymidine uptake and may act as an antimetabolite for nicotinic acid or vitamin B6. Finally, pyrithione may act as a general transport inhibitor through weak-acid-induced cytosolic acidification and hence partial dissipation of the transmembrane proton motive force (PMF) on which the transport of many organic and inorganic solutes is reliant.</Description>
