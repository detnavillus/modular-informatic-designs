<Description>The chloride salt form of rubidium-82, a positron emitting isotope used as an imaging tool. Rubidium chloride Rb-82 accumulates in myocardial cells and other tissues, and can be evaluated as a function of blood flow. By scintigraphic means, areas with decreased blood flow can be visualized due to decreased uptake of Rb-82.</Description>
