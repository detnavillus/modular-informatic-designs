<Description>The hydrochloride salt form of bromodiphenhydramine, a synthetic ethanolamine with histamine H1 antagonistic and sedative properties. Bromodiphenhydramine hydrochloride blocks the H1 histamine receptor and prevents the symptoms that are caused by histamine activity on capillaries, bronchial smooth muscle, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, including vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and spasmodic contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. This drug also prevents histamine-induced pain and itching of mucous membranes.</Description>
