<Description>A tripeptide that stimulates the release of THYROTROPIN and PROLACTIN. It is synthesized by the neurons in the PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS of the HYPOTHALAMUS. After being released into the pituitary portal circulation, TRH (was called TRF) stimulates the release of TSH and PRL from the ANTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND.</Description>
<Description>Expressed (highest) in the medial hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei and median eminence by human TRH Gene, 242-aa 27-kDa (precursor) (prepro-)Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone is a major regulator of TSH biosynthesis and release in the anterior pituitary gland and neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
