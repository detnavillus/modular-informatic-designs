<Description>A commercial combination preparation, by Novartis, containing chlorpheniramine maleate and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride used to relieve symptoms of the cold and allergy. Chlorpheniramine maleate, an antihistamine, blocks the effects of histamine, thereby preventing symptoms such as sneezing and itchy, watery eyes, runny nose and sore throat. Pseudoephedrine, a sympathomimetic agent, acts as a decongestant by inducing vasoconstriction mediated via alpha-adrenergic receptors. This reduces blood flow, decreases swelling and prevents nasal and sinus congestion.</Description>
