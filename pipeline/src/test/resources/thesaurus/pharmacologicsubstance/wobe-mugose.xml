<Description>An enzymatic preparation containing proteolytic enzymes papain, trypsin and chymotrypsin with potential anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities. Papain can be extracted from the fruit of the papaya plant. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are serine proteases produced and secreted by the pancreas. Although its exact mechanisms has yet to be fully illustrated, Wobe-Mugos E appears to have the ability to modulate the immune system by degrading cytokines, and cytokine receptors and clearing circulating immune protein complexes, as well as disrupting adhesion molecules. This agent has been shown to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity, inhibit tumor cell proliferation and prolong survival rates.</Description>
