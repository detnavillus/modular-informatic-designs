<Description>An orally available small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. Class III receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AC220 selectively inhibits class III receptor tyrosine kinases, including FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3/STK1), colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R/FMS), stem cell factor receptor (SCFR/KIT), and platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), resulting in inhibition of ligand-independent leukemic cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mutations in FLT3, resulting in constitutive activation, are the most frequent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and occur in approximately one-third of AML cases.</Description>
