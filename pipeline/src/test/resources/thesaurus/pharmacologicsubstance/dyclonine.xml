<Description>An unclassified compound with local anesthetic effect. Dyclonine reversibly binds to activated sodium channels on the neuronal membrane, thereby decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions, leading to an increased threshold for excitation. This reversibly stabilizes the membrane and inhibits depolarization, leading to the failure of a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade. This results in a transient and reversible loss of sensation in a localized area of the body.</Description>
