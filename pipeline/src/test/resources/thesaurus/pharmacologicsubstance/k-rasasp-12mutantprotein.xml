<Synonym>K-RAS ASP-12 Mutant Protein</Synonym>
<Description>A mutant form of the p21-ras protein transcribed from a mutant form of the oncogene K-ras.  K-Ras is located in the plasma membrane and transduces growth and differentiation signals from activated receptors to protein kinases within the cell.  K-RAS ASP-12 contains a mutation at codon 12 and may be used in cancer immunotherapy. (NCI04)</Description>
