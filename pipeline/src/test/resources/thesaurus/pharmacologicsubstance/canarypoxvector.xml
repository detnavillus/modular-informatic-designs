<Description>Any of the genetically engineered live canarypox vectors with application in anti-cancer therapy. Canarypox vectors retain the pancytotropism of most poxviruses, but is unable to productively replicate in non-avian species, thus eliminating the safety concerns exist with other vectors. Canarypox viral vector is designed to carry a gene of interest into a eukaryotic cell where the gene of interest can be expressed subsequently.</Description>
