<Description>A selective, orally available, 1,5-benzodiazepine-derivative gastrin/cholecystokinin 2 (CCK-2) receptor antagonist with potential antineoplastic activity. Z-360 binds to the gastrin/CCK-2 receptor, thereby preventing receptor activation by gastrin, a peptide hormone frequently associated with the proliferation of gastrointestinal and pancreatic tumor cells.</Description>
