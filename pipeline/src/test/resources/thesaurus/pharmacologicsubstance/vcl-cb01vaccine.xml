<Description>A vaccine consisting of two plasmids encoding the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) tegument phosphoprotein 65 (pp65), a major internal matrix protein, and glycoprotein B (gB), an important CMV component responsible for attachment and entry into cells, with immunostimulatory properties. Vaccination with VCL-CB01 may stimulate the host immune system to mount cellular and humoral immune responses against CMV positive cells, resulting in cell lysis.</Description>
