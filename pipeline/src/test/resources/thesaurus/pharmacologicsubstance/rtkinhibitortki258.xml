<Description>An orally active benzimidazole-quinolinone compound and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. TKI258 strongly binds to and inhibits the phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that promotes tumor cell proliferation and survival in certain cancer cells. Inhibition of FGFR3 may inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce tumor cell death. In addition, TKI258 also inhibits other members of the RTK superfamily, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, platelet-derived growth factor receptor type 3, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3, stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT), and colony stimulating factor receptor 1. This may further lead to a reduction of cellular proliferation and angiogenesis, and an induction of tumor cell apoptosis.</Description>
