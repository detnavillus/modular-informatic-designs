<Description>A phosphinic acid-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. Fosinoprilat specifically and competitively inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme thereby decreasing the formation of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, resulting in diminished vasopressor activity. In addition, angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion by adrenal cortex is decreased, which results in a decrease of sodium retention and an increase in water outflow.</Description>
