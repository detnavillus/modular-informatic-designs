<Description>A liposome-encapsulated formulation of the benzoquinazoline folate analog OSI-7904 with antineoplastic activity. As a thymidylate synthase inhibitor, OSI-7904 noncompetitively binds to thymidylate synthase, resulting in inhibition of thymine nucleotide synthesis and DNA replication. Liposome encapsulation improves the efficacy and increases the half-life of OSI-7904. (NCI04)</Description>
