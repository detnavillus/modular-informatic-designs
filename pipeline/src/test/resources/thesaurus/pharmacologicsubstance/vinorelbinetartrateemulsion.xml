<Description>An emulsion containing the tartrate salt of the semisynthetic vinca alkaloid vinorelbine with antineoplastic activity. Vinorelbine binds to tubulin, inhibiting tubulin polymerization into microtubules; cell division is prevented, the cell cycle is arrested metaphase and cell death ensues. In this formulation vinorelbine is emulsified in a homogeneous suspension of nanoparticles, which protects the venous endothelium from coming into direct contact with the active ingredient, potentially reducing vinorelbine-associated venous toxicity at the venous injection site.</Description>
