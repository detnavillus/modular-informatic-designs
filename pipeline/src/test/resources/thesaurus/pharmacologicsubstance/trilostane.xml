<Description>A synthetic derivative of androstane with adrenocortical suppressive properties.  Trilostane reversibly inhibits 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase delta 5-4 isomerase in the adrenal cortex, resulting in the decreased synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids and the decreased conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone.
