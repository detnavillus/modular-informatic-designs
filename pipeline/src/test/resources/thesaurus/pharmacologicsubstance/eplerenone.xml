<Description>A selective aldosterone receptor antagonist. Eplerenone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and blocks the binding of aldosterone, thereby decreasing sodium resorption and subsequently increasing water outflow. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure. Eplerenone is used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.</Description>
