<Description>A recombinant form of the heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF-5).  FGF-5 may function as a growth factor during embryogenesis and may have a role in wound repair throughout adulthood because of its mitogenic effects on fibroblasts and endothelial cells.  Overexpressed in certain tumor cell types, this agent may promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. (NCI04)</Description>
