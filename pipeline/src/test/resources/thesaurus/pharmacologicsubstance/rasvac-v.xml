<Description>A synthetic vaccine used for cancer immunotherapy also known as Ras(val 12)-Vaccinia Vaccine, RASVAC-C is based on a mutant peptide epitope of the Ras oncoprotein at codon 12 (valine instead of glycine) that induces recognition and induction of tumor-specific, cell-mediated immune responses. Ras is an intracellular GTP-binding protein involved in signal transduction and regulation of proliferation and differentiation. (NCI04)</Description>
