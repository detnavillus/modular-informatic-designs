<Description>A class of agents that inhibit nitric oxide synthases (NOS), enzymes which catalyze the production of nitric oxide (NO). The three known NOS isoforms (neuronal, endothelial and inducible) are all dimeric, bi-domain enzymes that contain iron protoporphyrin IX, flavin adenine dinucleotide, mononucleotide, and tetrahydrobiopterin as bound prosthetic groups.
