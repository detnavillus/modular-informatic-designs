<Description>A short-acting, beta-adrenergic receptor agonist with bronchodilator activity. Pirbuterol selectively binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, thereby activating intracellular adenyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, relieve bronchospasms, improve mucociliary clearance and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</Description>
<Description>The acetate salt form of pirbuterol, a synthetic catecholamine and a pyridine derivative with sympathomimetic and bronchodilatory effects. Pirbuterol acetate selectively stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, resulting in initiation of intracellular adenylate cyclase activity leading to increased levels of cAMP. As a result muscle relaxation (broncho- and vasodilation) occurs via cAMP-dependent signal transduction. In addition, elevated levels of cAMP inhibit release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells.</Description>
