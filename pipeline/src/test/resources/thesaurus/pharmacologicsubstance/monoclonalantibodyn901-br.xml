<Description>A synthetic immunotoxin consisting of the murine monoclonal antibody N901 conjugated with toxin-blocked ricin (BR).  Monoclonal antibody N901-BR binds to CD56, a neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) that is expressed by tumor cells of neuroectodermal origin (including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and neuroblastoma), and by normal cells (including neuroendocrine cells, cardiac muscle cells, and cells in peripheral nerve tissue).
