<Description>An ester alkaloid derived from Rauwolfia canescens with antihypertensive activity. Deserpidine is a competitive inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). By competing with angiotensin I for ACE, deserpidine blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. Reduced level of serum angiotensin II causes a decrease in blood pressure. Deserpidine also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.</Description>
