<Description>A 30-residue prostate specific antigen (PSA) oligoepitope peptide (OP) vaccine with potential antineoplastic activity.  PSA-OP peptide vaccine contains the PSA-1 and PSA-3 HLA-A2 epitopes and the PSA-9 HLA-class I-A3 epitope joined by peptide linker sequences.  In an animal model, vaccination with this agent has been shown to elicit a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune response. (NCI04)</Description>
