<Description>A small synthetic molecule and aurora kinase (AK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. AT9283 selectively binds to and inhibits AKs A and B, which are serine-threonine kinases that play essential roles in mitotic checkpoint control during mitosis. Inhibition of these kinases results in an inhibition of cellular division and proliferation in tumor cells that overexpress AKs.</Description>
