<Description>A non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. Moexiprilat competitively inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This prevents the actions of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and leads to vasodilatation. This agent also prevents angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, thereby promoting diuresis and natriuresis.</Description>
