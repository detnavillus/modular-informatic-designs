<Description>A semi-synthetic, orally bioavailable taxane derivative with potential antineoplastic properties. Oral taxane derivative DJ-927 binds to tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and stabilization and preventing microtubule depolymerization, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. As it represents poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms, this agent may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors. As the first oral taxane derivative, oral taxane derivative DJ-927 is more potent than paclitaxel and docetaxel.</Description>
