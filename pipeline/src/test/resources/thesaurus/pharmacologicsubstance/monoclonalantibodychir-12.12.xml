<Description>A monoclonal antibody directed against the B-cell surface antigen CD40 with potential antineoplastic activity. Monoclonal antibody CHIR-12.12 binds to and inhibits CD40, thereby inhibiting CD40 ligand-induced cell proliferation and triggering cell lysis via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in cells overexpressing CD40. CD40, an integral membrane protein found on the surface of B lymphocytes, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is highly expressed in a number of B-cell malignancies.</Description>
