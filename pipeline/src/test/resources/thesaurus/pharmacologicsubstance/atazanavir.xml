<Description>A synthetic antiviral agent.  As a symmetric azapeptide agent structurally different from other HIV protease inhibitors, atazanavir selectively binds to and inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease, thereby preventing cleavage of the gag-pol viral polyprotein and resulting in the release of immature, noninfectious virions.  This agent does not elevate serum lipids, a common problem with other protease inhibitors. (NCI04)</Description>
