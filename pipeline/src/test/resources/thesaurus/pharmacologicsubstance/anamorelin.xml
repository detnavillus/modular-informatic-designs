<Description>A synthetic, orally bioavailable, small-molecule ghrelin mimetic with appetite-stimulating and anabolic activities. RC-1291 ghrelin mimetic binds to and stimulates the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) centrally, thereby mimicking the appetite-stimulating and growth hormone-releasing effects of ghrelin. Stimulation of GHSR may also reduce the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and interleukin-6, which may play a direct role in cancer-related loss of appetite.</Description>
