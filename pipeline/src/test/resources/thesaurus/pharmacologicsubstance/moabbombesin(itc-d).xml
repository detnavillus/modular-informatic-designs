<Description>A monoclonal antibody directed against the neurohormone bombesin that is conjugated to isothiocyanobenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (ITC-D), a bifunctional chelating agent that allows the antibody to be labeled with a metal species. Levels of the neurohormone bombesin, also known as gastrin releasing peptide (GRP), are elevated in lung and thyroid cancers, where the substance acts as an autocrine growth factor.
