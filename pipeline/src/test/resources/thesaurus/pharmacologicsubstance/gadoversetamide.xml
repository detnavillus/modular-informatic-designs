<Description>A paramagnetic extracellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that facilitates visualization of abnormal vascularity. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoversetamide decreases T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time) values in tissues where it accumulates. At the recommended dose, the effect is primarily on T1 relaxation time, and produces an increase in signal intensity. Gadoversetamide does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier. However, abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoversetamide. (NCI05)</Description>
