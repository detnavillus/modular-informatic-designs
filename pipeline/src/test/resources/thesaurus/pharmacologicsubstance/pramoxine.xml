<Description>The hydrochloride salt form of pramoxine, a morpholine derivative with local anesthetic property. Pramoxine hydrochloride decreases the permeability of the neuronal membrane to sodium ions by reversibly binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels. This results in stabilization of the membrane and , thereby inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for membrane depolarization, hence resulting in the failure to initiate a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade.</Description>
