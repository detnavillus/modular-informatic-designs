<Description>The tartrate salt form of rivastigmine, a phenylcarbamate derivative exhibiting cognitive stimulating property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, rivastigmine tartrate may bind reversibly to cholinesterase, thereby decreasing the breakdown of acetylcholine and enhancing cholinergic function.</Description>
