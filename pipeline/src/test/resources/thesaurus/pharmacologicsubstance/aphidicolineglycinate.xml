<Description>A tetracyclic diterpene antibiotic isolated from the fungus Cephalosporium aphidicola and other fungal species with potential antineoplastic activity.  Aphidicoline glycinate blocks the cell cycle at early S-phase by specifically inhibiting DNA polymerases in eukaryotic cells, induces apoptosis, and stops the growth of eukaryotic cells and certain viruses by selectively inhibiting DNA polymerase II or viral-induced DNA polymerases.
