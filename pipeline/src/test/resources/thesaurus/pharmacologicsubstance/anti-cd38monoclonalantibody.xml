<Description>A fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the cell surface glycoprotein CD-38 with potential antineoplastic activity. The binding of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody to natural killer (NK) cells mimics the normal CD38-CD31 interaction on the NK cell surface. CD38 is also present on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and plasma leukemia cells; this agent may preferentially bind these cells, triggering antitumoral antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). CD38, a cell surface glycoprotein, is present on various immune cells and has been shown to regulate the cytotoxic response of activated NK cells.</Description>
