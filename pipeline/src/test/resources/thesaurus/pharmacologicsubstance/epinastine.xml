<Description>An histamine H1 receptor antagonist without sedative activity. Epinastine hydrochloride blocks the histamine H1 receptor and inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells. This prevents the typical allergic symptoms that are caused by histamine activity on capillaries, skin, mucous membranes, and on gastrointestinal and bronchial smooth muscles. Typical histamine activities include vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, pain, itching, and spasmodic contractions of gastrointestinal smooth muscles. Epinastine also has affinity for the histamine H2, 5-HT2, and the alpha-1, alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.</Description>
