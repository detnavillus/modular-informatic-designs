<Description>A propylamine derivative with sympathomimetic property. Propylhexedrine binds to and activates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the mucosa of the respiratory tract, thereby mimicking the actions of norepinephrine and epinephrine. This results in vasoconstriction and reduces swelling and inflammation of the mucous membrane lining, therefore relieving nasal and sinus congestion.</Description>
