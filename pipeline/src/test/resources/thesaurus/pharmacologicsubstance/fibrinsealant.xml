<Description>A plasma-derived fibrin biomatrix preparation consisting of two separate solutions that are combined on application. The sealer protein solution contains clottable human fibrinogen and bovine aprotinin, a fibrinolysis inhibitor; the thrombin solution contains human thrombin and calcium chloride. When the solutions are combined, a clot is formed, reproducing the final stages of the coagulation cascade.</Description>
