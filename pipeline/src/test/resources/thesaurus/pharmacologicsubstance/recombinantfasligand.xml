<Description>A recombinant agent, which is chemically identical to or similar to the endogenous protein Fas ligand, a protein related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) with potential antineoplastic activity.  Fas ligand binds to the Fas receptor, thereby activating caspases and inducing apoptosis. (NCI04)</Description>
