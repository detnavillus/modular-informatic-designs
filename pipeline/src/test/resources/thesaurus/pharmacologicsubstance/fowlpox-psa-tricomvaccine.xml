<Description>A cancer vaccine consisting of a recombinant fowlpox virus encoding human prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and TRICOM, a combination of three immunostimulants (i.e., B7.1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3). Administration of this agent may induce a cytotoxic T cell response against PSA-expressing tumor cells. Dendritic cells infected with TRICOM vectors greatly enhance naive T-cell activation and peptide-specific T-cell stimulation. Fowlpox virus is an attractive vector because its genome is easy to manipulate and it is replication incompetent in mammalian cells.</Description>
