<Description>The husk of the dried ripe seeds of the Plantago psyllium, P. Indica, P. Ovata, and P. Arenaria plants with laxative and cholesterol lowering activities. The husks contain mucilage that swells on exposure to water and provides an indigestible mucilaginous mass in the intestines, thereby causing lubrication, contraction of the smooth muscles of the intestinal walls, and thus stimulating bowel movement. Psyllium husk is rich in soluble fiber and has a cholesterol-lowering effect.</Description>
<Description>Dried, ripe seeds of Plantago psyllium, P. indica, and P. ovata (Plantaginaceae). Plantain seeds swell in water and are used as demulcents and bulk laxatives.</Description>
