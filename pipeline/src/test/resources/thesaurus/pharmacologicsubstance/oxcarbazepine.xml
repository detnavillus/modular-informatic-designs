<Description>A dibenzazepine carboxamide derivative with an anticonvulsant property. As a prodrug, oxcarbazepine is converted to its active metabolite, 10-monohydroxy. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, electrophysiological studies indicate this agent blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby stabilizing hyper-excited neural membranes, inhibiting repetitive neuronal firing, and decreasing the propagation of synaptic impulses.</Description>
