<Description>An herb obtained from the plant Harpagophytum procumbens.  Devil's claw has been used as a tonic, as a hypoglycemic, to cleanse the lymph system, and in the treatment of arthritis, rheumatism, and skin cancer.  This agent may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, possibly due to the presence of antioxidants, phenols, tannins, triterpenoids and volatile oils. (NCI04)</Description>
