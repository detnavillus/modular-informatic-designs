<Description>An azetidinone derivative and a cholesterol absorption inhibitor with lipid-lowering activity. Ezetimibe appears to interact physically with cholesterol transporters at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related phytosterols. As a result, ezetimibe causes a decrease in the level of blood cholesterol or an increase in the clearance of cholesterol from the bloodstream. Overall, the following effects observed are a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and a reduction of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and other triglycerides in the blood.</Description>
