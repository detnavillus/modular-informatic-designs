<Description>An IgG3 monoclonal antibody directed against anionic phospholipids with potential antineoplastic activity. Chimeric anti-phosphotidylserine monoclonal antibody binds to anionic phospholipids in a beta 2-glycoprotein I-dependent manner, inhibiting tumor growth by stimulating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to tumor vessels.</Description>
