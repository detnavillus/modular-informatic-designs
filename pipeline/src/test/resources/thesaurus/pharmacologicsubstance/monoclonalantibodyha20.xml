<Description>A monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen with potential antineoplastic activity. Monoclonal antibody hA20 (mAb hA20) is a fully humanized antibody that targets the CD20 antigen, a hydrophobic transmembrane protein located on normal pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. Following binding, mAb hA20 triggers a complement-dependent cell lysis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in cells overexpressing CD20. (NCI05)</Description>
