<Description>A structural analogue of erastin with potential antineoplastic activity. Erastin analogue PRLX 93936 appears to inhibit mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDACs (voltage-dependent anion channels) 2 and 3, resulting in an oxidative, non-apoptotic cell death. Erastin analogue PRLX 93936 exhibits greater lethality in cell lines harboring mutations in the GTPase protein oncogenes HRAS and KRAS or the serine-threonine protein kinase oncogene BRAF than in non-tumorigenic cell lines. VDACs 2 and 3 are up-regulated in a wide variety of tumor cell lines.</Description>
