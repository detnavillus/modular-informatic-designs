<Description>The alcoholic extract of the bulb or whole garlic plant Allium sativum (Liliaceae) with potential antineoplastic activity. The garlic plant has long been considered a beneficial plant for health and has been used as an antihelmintic, a rubefacient, an anti-infective, and an antihypertensive. Fresh or aged, garlic extracts contain compounds such as diallyl and allyl propyl disulfides with potent antioxidant, cholesterol-lowering properties; regular ingestion may be preventative for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.
