<Description>A thiocarboxanilide derivative, belongs to the second generation of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), with anti-viral activity. Uniroyal compound 38 (UC-38), is a non-competitive inhibitor of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), which catalyzes the conversion of genomic RNA into double-stranded pro-viral DNA after cell entry. UC-38 binds to a hydrophobic pocket close to but distinct from the polymerase active site in the p66 subunit and inhibits enzyme activity by mediating allosteric changes in the RT. Inhibition of HIV-1 RT results in termination of viral proliferation.</Description>
