<Synonym>rVaccinia-CEA(D609)/MUC1(L93)/TRICOM Vaccine</Synonym>
<Description>A cancer vaccine comprised of a recombinant vaccinia viral vector encoding the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), MUC-1 (mucin-1), a transmembrane glycoprotein secreted by glandular tissues, and TRICOM, comprised of the three co-stimulatory molecule transgenes B7-1, ICAM-1 and LFA-3. Upon administration, inalimarev may enhance CEA and MUC-1 presentation to antigen presenting cells (APC) and may activate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against CEA- and MUC-1-expressing tumor cells.</Description>
