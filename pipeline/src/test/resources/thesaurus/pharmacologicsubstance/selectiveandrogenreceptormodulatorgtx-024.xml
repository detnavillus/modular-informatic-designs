<Description>A non-steroidal agent with anabolic activity. Selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) GTx-024 is designed to work like testosterone, thus promoting and/or maintaining libido, fertility, prostate growth, and muscle growth and strength. Mimicking testosterone's action, this agent may increase lean body mass, thereby ameliorating muscle wasting in the hypermetabolic state of cancer cachexia.</Description>
