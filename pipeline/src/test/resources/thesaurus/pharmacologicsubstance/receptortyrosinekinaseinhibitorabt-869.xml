<Description>An orally bioavailable receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ABT-869 inhibits members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor families; it exhibits much less activity against unrelated RTKs, soluble tyrosine kinases, or serine/threonine kinases. This agent does not have a general antiproliferative effect due to its high dose requirement. However, ABT-869 may exhibit potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on tumor cells whose proliferation is dependent on mutant kinases, such as FMS-related tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3).</Description>
