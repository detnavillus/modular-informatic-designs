<Description>The lactate salt form of squalamine, an aminosterol isolated from tissues of the dogfish shark Squalus acanthias.  Possessing anti-angiogenic properties, squalamine inhibits the sodium-hydrogen exchanger NHE3, resulting in suppression of endothelial cell proliferation and migration.  This agent also has broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. (NCI04)</Description>
