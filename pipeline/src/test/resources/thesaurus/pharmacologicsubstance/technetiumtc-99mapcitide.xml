<Description>A radioconjugate comprised of the small peptide apcitide labeled with the gamma-emitting technetium TC99m (metastable Tc-99). Apcitide binds to platelet glycoprotein (GP) GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of activated platelets. Labeling apcitide with TC99m allows localization of thrombus formation by gamma-ray imaging equipment and the ability to distinguish between old, inactive thrombi and new, active thrombi.</Description>
