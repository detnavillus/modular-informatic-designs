<Description>An analogue of the hormone vasopressin with antidiuretic and antihemorrhagic properties. Desmopressin acetate has selective affinity for the V2 receptor and acts on the distal kidney tubule by increasing the cellular permeability thereby stimulating water reabsorption. This antidiuretic agent is used in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus. An unrelated action of desmopressin acetate is to increases circulating factor VIII and is used in patients with haemophilia and von Willebrand's disease.</Description>
<Description>A synthetic octapeptide, and an analogue of human hormone arginine vasopressin with antidiuretic and coagulant activities. Desmopressin binds to V2 receptors in renal collecting ducts which leads to exocytosis of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) from Weibel-Palade bodies, thereby increasing water resorption. This agent also increases nitric oxide (NO) production via activation of endothelial NO synthase, thereby induces afferent arteriolar vasodilation. Furthermore, desmopressin stimulates the release of factor VIII from endothelial cells mediated through V1a receptor, thereby promotes blood coagulation.</Description>
