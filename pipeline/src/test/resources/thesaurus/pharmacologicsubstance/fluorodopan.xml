<Description>An alkylating agent with potential antineoplastic activity.  Fluorodopan alkylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine.  Alkylating agents exert cytotoxic and, in some cases, chemotherapeutic effects by transferring alkyl groups to DNA, thereby damaging DNA and interfering with DNA replication and cell division.
