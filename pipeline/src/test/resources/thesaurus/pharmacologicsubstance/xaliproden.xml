<Synonym>Xaliproden Hydrochloride</Synonym>
<Description>The hydrochloride salt of xaliproden, an orally-active, synthetic, non-peptidic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1A receptor agonist with neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities. Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, xaliproden appears to either mimic the effects of neurotrophins or stimulate their synthesis, thereby stimulating neuronal cell differentiation and proliferation and inhibiting neuronal cell death. The neuroprotective effect of this agent involves the activation of MAP kinase pathways via stimulation of the 5-HT1A receptor.</Description>
