<Description>A recombinant peptide fragment containing adhesion domains of fibronectin. Fibronectin is high molecular weight glycoprotein, and has important roles in cell adhesion, morphology, and surface architecture. Fibronectin fragment CH-296 is used in retroviral-based gene transfer procedures, which utilizes adhesive property of fibronectin to bring virions to target cells and to facilitate co-localization, thereby increasing gene transfer efficiency.</Description>
