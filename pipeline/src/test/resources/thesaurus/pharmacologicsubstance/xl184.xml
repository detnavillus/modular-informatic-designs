<Description>An orally bioavailable, small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. XL184 strongly binds to and inhibits several tyrosine receptor kinases. Specifically, XL184 appears to have a strong affinity for the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which may result in inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis, and tumor regression. This agent has also been shown to inhibit mast/stem cell growth factor (KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) and tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (Tie-2).</Description>
