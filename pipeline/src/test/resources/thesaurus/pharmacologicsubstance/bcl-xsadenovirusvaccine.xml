<Synonym>Bcl-Xs Adenovirus Vaccine</Synonym>
<Description>A vaccine consisting of replication-defective recombinant adenovirus that encodes for Bcl-Xs with potential antineoplastic activity.  Vaccination with Bcl-Xs adenovirus vaccine induces apoptosis in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL positive cancer cells, resulting in decreased tumor growth while leaving normal cells unaffected.  Bcl-Xs block the function of the protooncogenes Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL which are overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors and promote cancer cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. (NCI04)</Description>
