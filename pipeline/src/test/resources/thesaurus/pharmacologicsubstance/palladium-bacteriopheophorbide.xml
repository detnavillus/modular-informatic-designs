<Description>A novel palladium-substituted bacteriochlorophyll derivative and photosensitizer with potential antitumor activity. Upon administration, inactive palladium-bacteriopheophorbide is activated locally when the tumor bed is exposed to photoirradiation; the activated form induces local cytotoxic processes, resulting in local tissue damage, disruption of tumor vasculature, and tumor hypoxia and necrosis.</Description>
