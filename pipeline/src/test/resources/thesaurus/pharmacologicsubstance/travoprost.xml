<Description>A synthetic lipophilic isopropyl ester prodrug of the active compound travoprost free acid, a prostaglandin F2alpha analog with anti-glaucoma property. Upon administration, travoprost is hydrolysed to a free acid by corneal esterases, and then selectively stimulating the prostaglandin F (FP prostanoid) receptor, thereby increasing the uveoscleral outflow which leads to a reduction in intra-ocular pressure.</Description>
