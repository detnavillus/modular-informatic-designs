<Description>An herbal extract derived from the root of the plant Angelica sinensis with possible antiinflammatory, antispasmodic, vasodilatory, estrogenic, and antitumor activities. Angelica sinensis contains volatile oils, including safrole, isosafrole, and n-butylphthalide; as well as coumarin derivatives, such as psoralens, bergapten, osthol, imperatorin, and oxypeucedanin; and ferulic acid. The coumarin derivatives in this agent may contribute to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation, as well as exhibit additive anticoagulant effects. Ferulic acid, a phenolic phytochemical present in plant cell walls, may neutralize reactive oxygen species. In addition, Angelica sinensis extract has been shown to inhibit the growth and induce apoptosis of glioblastoma multiforme brain tumor cells through p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways.</Description>
