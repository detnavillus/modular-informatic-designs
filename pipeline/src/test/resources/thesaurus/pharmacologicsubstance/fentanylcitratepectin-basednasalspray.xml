<Description>A sublingual preparation of a synthetic anilidopiperidine opioid with analgesic activity. After rapid sublingual transmucosal absorption, the active ingredient fentanyl selectively binds to and activates mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), mimicking the effects of endogenous opiates. Due to its quick onset and short duration of action, the administration of fentanyl sublingual spray may relief breakthrough pain.</Description>
