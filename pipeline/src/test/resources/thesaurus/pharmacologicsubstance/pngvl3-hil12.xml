<Description>A plasmid vector encoding interleukin-12 (IL-12) with potential use in the gene therapy of cancer.  pNGVL3-hIL12 may induce a high level of IL-12 protein expression during transient transfection of host cells.  IL-12 is a proinflammatory cytokine with numerous immunoregulatory functions and may augment host immune responses to tumor cells. (NCI04)</Description>
