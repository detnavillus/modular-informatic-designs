<Description>A recombinant retrovirus containing the modified murine retroviral vector MFG-S encoding a chimeric construct, MOv18-gamma. MOv18 is a murine monoclonal antibody developed against epitope of human folate binding protein, which is overexpressed on more than 90% of non-mucinous epithelial ovarian neoplasms. The chimeric construct (MOv18-gamma) encodes the variable region of MOv18 antibody, and the gamma chain of human T-cell receptor. This virion might be used to transduce autologous T lymphocytes, and reintroduced back to the patient after expansion ex vivo to invoke specific immune response against ovarian cancer cells.</Description>
