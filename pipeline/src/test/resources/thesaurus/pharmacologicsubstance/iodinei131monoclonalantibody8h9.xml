<Description>A radioimmunoconjugate of a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 8H9 labeled with iodine 131 (I 131), with imaging and radioimmunotherapeutic properties. MoAb 8H9 recognizes a 58 KDa cell surface glycoprotein found in many solid tumors, including breast cancers, childhood sarcomas, and neuroblastomas, but is not reactive with normal human tissues. I 131 MoAb 8H9 effectively targets tumor cells expressing this unique glycoprotein and may play a radioimmunotherapic role in a variety of solid tumors.</Description>
