<Description>A form of mineral iron for oral administration, Ferrous Gluconate is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine and combines with apoferritin to form ferritin, which is stored in the liver, spleen, red bone marrow, and intestinal mucosa. Important in transport of oxygen by hemoglobin to the tissues, iron is also found in myoglobin, transferrin, and ferritin, and is as a component of many enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase, and cytochromes.
