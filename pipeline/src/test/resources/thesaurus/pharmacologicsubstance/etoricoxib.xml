<Description>A synthetic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with antipyretic, analgesic, and potential antineoplastic properties. Etoricoxib specifically binds to and inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), resulting in inhibition of the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Inhibition of COX-2 may induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis.</Description>
