<Description>A sulfonylurea with antihyperglycemic activity. Glimepiride binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, thereby reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin, and thereby results in a reduction of the blood glucose level. In addition, this agent increases the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin.</Description>
