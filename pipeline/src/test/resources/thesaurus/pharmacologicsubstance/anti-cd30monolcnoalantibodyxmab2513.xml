<Description>A humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the cell surface receptor CD30 with potential immunotherapeutic activity. Anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody XmAb2513 specifically binds to the CD30 antigen, which may result in a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against CD30-expressing tumor cells. CD30, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is expressed on activated lymphocytes transiently and is constitutively expressed in hematologic malignancies including Hodgkin's disease and some T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.</Description>
