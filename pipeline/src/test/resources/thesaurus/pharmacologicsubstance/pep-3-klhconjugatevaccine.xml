<Description>A cancer vaccine consisting of PEP-3, a synthetic peptide encompassing a tumor-specific mutated segment of the epidermal growth factor receptor type vIII (EGFRvIII), conjugated to the naturally-occuring immunoadjuvant keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, PEP-3-KLH conjugate vaccine may induce a cytotoxic immune response against tumor cells that overexpress EGFRvIII; this antitumoral immune response may involve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</Description>
