<Description>A pentavalent arsenical compound with antiprotozoal and antihelmintic properties. Although its mechanism of action is not fully known, acetarsone may bind to protein-containing sulfhydryl groups located in the parasite, thereby forming lethal As-S bonds. This may prevent their functioning and eventually kill the parasite.</Description>
