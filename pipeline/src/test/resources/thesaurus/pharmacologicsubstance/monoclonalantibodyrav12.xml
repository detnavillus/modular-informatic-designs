<Description>A chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against a primate-restricted N-linked carbohydrate epitope (glycotope) expressed on various human carcinomas with potential antineoplastic activity. Following binding, monoclonal antibody RAV12 disrupts sodium channels of tumor cells expressing this glycotope, resulting in cell and organelle swelling, loss of membrane integrity, and cell death.
