<Description>A highly specific, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) antagonist with potential antiangiogenic activity. Derived from human fibronectin, VEGFR-2 inhibitor peptide CT-322 may block the activation of VEGFR-2 by all known activating ligands, thereby inhibiting the growth of new tumor blood vessels.</Description>
