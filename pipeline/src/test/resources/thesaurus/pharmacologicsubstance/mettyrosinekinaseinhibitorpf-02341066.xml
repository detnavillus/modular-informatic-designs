<Description>An orally bioavailable agent belonging to the class of c-met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors with potential antineoplastic activity. MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor PF-02341066 inhibits the membrane receptor MET and activation of the MET signaling pathway, which may block tumor cell growth, migration and invasion, and tumor angiogenesis in susceptible tumor cell populations.</Description>
