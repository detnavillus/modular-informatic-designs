<Description>A hydrocarbon-based polymer containing a pyran nucleus used to bioconjugate various drugs,. Use of a pyran polymer-drug bioconjugate may alter the biodistribution of a low molecular weight drug, resulting in disease-specific targeting with reduced drug access to sites of toxicity such as the bone marrow; the large size of the bioconjugate does not allow the active agent to pass the blood-bone marrow barrier.
