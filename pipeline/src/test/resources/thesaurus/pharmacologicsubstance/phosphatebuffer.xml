<Description>A chemical reagent containing at least any one of the many phosphoric acid derivatives, usually in salt form.  The phosphoric salt may be one of three types: strongly acid monometallic, neutral or mildly alkaline dimetallic, and strongly alkaline tri-metallic.  Phosphate buffers are typically adjusted to maintain a certain pH or are "buffered" with other chemical compounds.  Phosphate reagents are used in research laboratories, medicine or industry in various technical procedures. (NCI04)</Description>
