<Description>A quinazolone compound with anti-tumor activity. PD-168393 is a cell-permeable, irreversible, and selective inhibitor of ligand-dependent epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). This agent binds to the catalytic domain of EGFR with a 1:1 stoichiometry and inactivates the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity through alkylation of a cystine residue (Cys-773) within the ATP-binding pocket, thereby inhibiting proliferation of EGFR-expressing tumor cells.</Description>
