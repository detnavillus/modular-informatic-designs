<Description>Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) harvested directly from infiltrate of a patient's melanoma and cultured with interleukin-2 to expand the TIL cell population. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have specific activity against the melanoma from which they are derived. Introducing these melanoma tumor-reactive autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes back into the same patient may enhance a cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response against the melanoma cancer cells.</Description>
