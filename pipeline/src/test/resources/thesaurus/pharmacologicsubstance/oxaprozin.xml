<Description>A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derivative of oxazole-propionic acid with analgesic and antipyretic properties.  As a first generation NSAID inhibitor, oxaprozin binds to and inactivates both isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and-2), thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to pro-inflammatory prostaglandins.  When inhibiting COX-2, this agent may be effective in relieving pain and inflammation; when inhibiting COX-1, it may produce unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects. (NCI04)</Description>
<Description>The potassium salt form of oxaprozin and a member of the propionic acid group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Oxaprozin potassium reversibly and competitively inhibits cyclooxygenases (COX), thereby blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. This inhibits the formation of prostaglandins that are involved in pain, inflammation and fever.</Description>
