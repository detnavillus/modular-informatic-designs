<Description>A sublingual preparation of a synthetic anilidopiperidine opioid with analgesic activity. After rapid sublingual transmucosal absorption, the active ingredient fentanyl selectively binds to and activates mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), mimicking the effects of endogenous opiates. In addition to analgesia, pharmacological effects of this agent include anxiolysis, euphoria, feelings of relaxation, respiratory depression, constipation, miosis, and cough suppression.</Description>
