<Description>A synthetic heterocyclic pyridinium compound. MKT-077 is a water soluble lipophilic cationic molecule and an analog of rhodacyanine dye, which partitions into tumor cell mitochondria where it is thought to act as a metabolic poison, leading to G1 arrest and apoptosis. This agent also shows selective cytotoxicity to cancer cells mediated by its binding to the hsp70 family protein mot-2 and reactivation of tumor suppressor p53 function.</Description>
