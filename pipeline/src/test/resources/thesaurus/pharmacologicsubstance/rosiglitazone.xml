<Description>An orally-active thiazolidinedione with antidiabetic properties and potential antineoplastic activity.  Rosiglitazone activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), a ligand-activated transcription factor, thereby inducing cell differentiation and inhibiting cell growth and angiogenesis.  This agent also modulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes, inhibits macrophage and monocyte activation, and stimulates adipocyte differentiation. (NCI04)</Description>
<Description>The maleate salt form of rosiglitazone, an orally-active thiazolidinedione with antidiabetic properties and potential antineoplastic activity.  Rosiglitazone activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), a ligand-activated transcription factor, thereby inducing cell differentiation and inhibiting cell growth and angiogenesis.
