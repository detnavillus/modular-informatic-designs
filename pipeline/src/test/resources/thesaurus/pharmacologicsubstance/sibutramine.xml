<Description>The hydrochloride salt form of sibutramine, a phenethylamine derivative with appetite depressant property. Sibutramine hydrochloride metabolites M1 and M2 competitively inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, serotonin, and to a lesser degree dopamine by pre-synaptic nerve terminals, thereby promoting a sense of satiety, leading to a decrease in calorie intake, and possibly an increase in resting metabolic rate. This agent does not exhibit anticholinergic or antihistaminic effects.</Description>
