<Description>A recombinant, murine monoclonal antibody directed against gastrin-releasing peptide, one of a number of bombesin-like peptides (BLP). Tumor cells, such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, express and secrete BLP that activate specific cell growth-promoting receptors. Monoclonal antibody 2A11 has been shown to decrease the growth of SCLC cells in vitro and in animal models. (NCI04)</Description>
