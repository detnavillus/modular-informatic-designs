<Description>A selective thiophene-derived tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-930 inhibits stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which may result in the inhibition of both tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Both c-Kit and VEGFR2 are overexpressed in a variety of cancers.</Description>
