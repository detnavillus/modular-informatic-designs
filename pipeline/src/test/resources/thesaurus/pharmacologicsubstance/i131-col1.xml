<Description>A radioimmunoconjugate of a murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) COL1, labeled with iodine 131 (I-131). COL1 recognizes an epitope of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is over-expressed in many tumor cell types. I-131 MoAb COL1 delivers beta and gamma radiation emitting I-131 nuclide directly to tumor cells that express CEA, thereby allowing imaging and/or treatment of cancers.</Description>
