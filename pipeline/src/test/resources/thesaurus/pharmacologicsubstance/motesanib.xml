<Description>A diphosphate salt of motesanib, an orally bioavailable receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. AMG 706 selectively targets and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR), Kit, and Ret receptors, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis and cellular proliferation.
