<Description>An early onset form of phytanic acid storage disease with clinical and biochemical signs different from those of REFSUM DISEASE. Features include MENTAL RETARDATION; SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS; OSTEOPOROSIS; and severe liver damage.  It can be caused by mutation in a number of genes encoding proteins involving in the biogenesis or assembly of PEROXISOMES.</Description>
