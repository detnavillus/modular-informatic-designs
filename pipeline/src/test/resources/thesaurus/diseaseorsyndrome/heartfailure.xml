<Description>A heterogeneous condition in which the heart is unable to pump out sufficient blood to meet the metabolic need of the body. Heart failure can be caused by structural defects, functional abnormalities (VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION), or a sudden overload beyond its capacity. Chronic heart failure is more common than acute heart failure which results from sudden insult to cardiac function, such as MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.Heart failure caused by dysfunction of the MYOCARDIUM, leading to defective cardiac emptying (contraction) or filling (relaxation).Heart failure involving the LEFT VENTRICLE.Heart failure involving the RIGHT VENTRICLE.Heart failure accompanied by EDEMA, such as swelling of the legs and ankles and congestion in the lungs.</Description>
<Description>Inability of the heart to pump blood at an adequate rate to meet tissue metabolic requirements or the ability to do so only at an elevated filling pressure.</Description>
