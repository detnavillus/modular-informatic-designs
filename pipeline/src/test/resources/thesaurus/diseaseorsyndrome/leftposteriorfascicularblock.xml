<Description>An impairment of transmission of the cardiac electrical impulse along the fibers of the left posterior fascicle. In pure left posterior fascicular block (LPFB), the impulse emerges from the unblocked anterosuperior division, thus producing small q waves in leads II, III, and aVF. Thereafter, the impulse moves through the electrically predominant left ventricle in an inferior and rightward direction, thus explaining the S waves in leads I and aVL as well as the R waves in leads II, III, and aVF.</Description>
