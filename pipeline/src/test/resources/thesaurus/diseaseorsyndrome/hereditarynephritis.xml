<Description>A genetic syndrome usually inherited as an X-link trait.  It is caused by abnormalities in the COL4A5 gene.  It affects males more often than females and is characterized by hematuria, progressive renal insufficiency, hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities.</Description>
<Description>A group of inherited conditions characterized initially by HEMATURIA and slowly progressing to RENAL INSUFFICIENCY. The most common form is the Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis with HEARING LOSS) which is caused by mutations in genes for TYPE IV COLLAGEN and defective GLOMERULAR BASEMENT MEMBRANE.</Description>
