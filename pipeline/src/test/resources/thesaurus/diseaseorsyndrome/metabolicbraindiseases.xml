<Description>Acquired or inborn metabolic diseases that produce brain dysfunction or damage. These include primary (i.e., disorders intrinsic to the brain) and secondary (i.e., extracranial) metabolic conditions that adversely affect cerebral function.Brain dysfunction or damage caused by acquired (i.e., non-inborn) metabolic disorders. Associated conditions include ENDOCRINE DISEASES; WATER-ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE; KIDNEY DISEASES; LIVER DISEASES; anoxia (HYPOXIA, BRAIN); nutritional disorders (see NUTRITIONAL AND METABOLIC DISEASES); an encephalopathy associated with HEMODIALYSIS; and other disorders.
