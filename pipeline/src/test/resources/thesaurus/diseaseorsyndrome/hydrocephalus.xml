<Description>Excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the cranium which may be associated with dilation of cerebral ventricles, INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; HEADACHE; lethargy; URINARY INCONTINENCE; and ATAXIA (and in infants macrocephaly). This condition may be caused by obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pathways due to neurologic abnormalities, INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGES; CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFECTIONS; BRAIN NEOPLASMS; CRANIOCEREBRAL TRAUMA; and other conditions. Impaired resorption of cerebrospinal fluid from the arachnoid villi results in a communicating form of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo refers to ventricular dilation that occurs as a result of brain substance loss from CEREBRAL INFARCTION and other conditions.</Description>
