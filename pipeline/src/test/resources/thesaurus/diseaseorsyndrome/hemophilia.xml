<Description>A deficiency or abnormality of a blood coagulation factor characterized by the tendency to spontaneous or exaggerated post-traumatic hemorrhage, Hemophilia is typically a hereditary disorder but, rarely, may be acquired. Inherited coagulation factor-deficient hemophilias include hemophilia A or classic hemophilia (factor VIII deficiency) hemophilia B or Christmas disease (factor IX deficiency), and hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency). In individuals without hereditary hemophilia A, factor VIII inhibitors may occur spontaneously as autoantibodies, resulting in a condition known as 'acquired hemophilia.' Approximately 10 % of patients with acquired hemophilia have an underlying malignancy.</Description>
