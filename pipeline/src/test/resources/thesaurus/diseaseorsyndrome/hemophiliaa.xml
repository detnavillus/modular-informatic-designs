<Description>The classic hemophilia resulting from a deficiency of factor VIII. It is an inherited disorder of blood coagulation characterized by a permanent tendency to hemorrhage.</Description>
<Description>An inherited deficiency of coagulation factor VIII characterized by the tendency to spontaneous or exaggerated post-traumatic hemorrhage. Inherited as an x-linked recessive disease, hemophilia A is the most common hemophilia, occurring in approximately 1 in 10,000 male births.</Description>
