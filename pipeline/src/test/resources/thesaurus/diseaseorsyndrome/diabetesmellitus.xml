<Description>A heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by HYPERGLYCEMIA and GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE.</Description>
<Description>Type 2 diabetes, characterized by target-tissue resistance to insulin, is epidemic in industrialized societies and is strongly associated with obesity; however, the mechanism by which increased adiposity causes insulin resistance is unclear.  Adipocytes secrete a unique signalling molecule, which was named resistin (for resistance to insulin).  Circulating resistin levels are decreased by the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone, and increased in diet-induced and genetic forms of obesity.  Administration of anti-resistin antibody improves blood sugar and insulin action in mice with diet-induced obesity.  Moreover, treatment of normal mice with recombinant resistin impairs glucose tolerance and insulin action.  Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipocytes is enhanced by neutralization of resistin and is reduced by resistin treatment.  Resistin is thus a hormone that potentially links obesity to diabetes.</Description>
