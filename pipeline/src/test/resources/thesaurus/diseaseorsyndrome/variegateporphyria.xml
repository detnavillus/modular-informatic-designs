<Description>An autosomal dominant porphyria that is due to a deficiency of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4) in the LIVER, the seventh enzyme in the 8-enzyme biosynthetic pathway of HEME. Clinical features include both neurological symptoms and cutaneous lesions. Patients excrete increased levels of porphyrin precursors, COPROPORPHYRINS and protoporphyrinogen.</Description>
