<Description>A hereditary condition clinically resembling HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, but caused by failure of response to rather than deficiency of parathyroid hormones. It is characterized by hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, and is commonly associated with short stature, obesity, short metacarpals, and ectopic calcification. (Dorland, 27th ed)</Description>
