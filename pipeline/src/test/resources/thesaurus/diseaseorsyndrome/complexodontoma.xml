<Description>A benign, slow growing, and painless hamartomatous tumor occurring in tooth-bearing areas of the jaws. It is one of the most common odontogenic tumors and it usually affects children, adolescents, and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of enamel and dentin and the absence of tooth-like structures. It is treated with local excision. If it is incompletely removed, it may recur.</Description>
