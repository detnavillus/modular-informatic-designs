<Description>A combination of opsoclonus (involuntary conjugate eye movements of large amplitude) and myoclonic jerks. This can be a paraneoplastic syndrome (a result of brain metastasis) or post-infectious (viral encephalitis).</Description>
<Description>A neurological condition that is characterized by uncontrolled rapid irregular movements of the eye (OPSOCLONUS) and the muscle (MYOCLONUS) causing unsteady, trembling gait. It is also known as dancing eyes-dancing feet syndrome and is often associated with neoplasms, viral infections, or autoimmune disorders involving the nervous system.</Description>
