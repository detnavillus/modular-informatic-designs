<Description>Chronic glomerulonephritis characterized histologically by proliferation of MESANGIAL CELLS, increase in the MESANGIAL EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX, and a thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. This may appear as a primary disorder or secondary to other diseases including infections and autoimmune disease SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS. Various subtypes are classified by their abnormal ultrastructures and immune deposits. Hypocomplementemia is a characteristic feature of all types of MPGN.A type of mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis that is characterized by subepithelial immune deposit and may be a variant of type I.A type of mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis that is characterized by immune deposits on the endothelial side of the GLOMERULAR BASEMENT MEMBRANE leading to splitting and reduplication of the basement membrane.A type of mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis that is characterized by the dark bands of electron-dense deposits in the GLOMERULAR BASEMENT MEMBRANE caused by autoantibodies against ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY C3 CONVERTASE (C3bBb).</Description>
