<Description>X-linked or autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects of both humoral and cell mediated immunity, resulting in low or absent antibody levels, leukopenia, marked susceptibility to infections, and early death.--2004</Description>
<Description>Group of rare congenital disorders characterized by impairment of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, leukopenia, and low or absent antibody levels. It is inherited as an X-linked or autosomal recessive defect. Mutations occurring in many different genes cause human Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID).</Description>
