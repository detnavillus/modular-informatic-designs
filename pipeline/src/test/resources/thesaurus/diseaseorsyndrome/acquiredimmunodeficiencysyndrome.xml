<Description>A syndrome resulting from the acquired deficiency of cellular immunity caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  It is characterized by the reduction of the Helper T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and the lymph nodes.  Symptoms include generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and chronic diarrhea.  Patients with AIDS are especially susceptible to opportunistic infections (usually pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, tuberculosis, candida infections, and cryptococcosis), and the development of malignant neoplasms (usually non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma).  The human immunodeficiency virus is transmitted through sexual contact, sharing of contaminated needles, or transfusion of contaminated blood. -- 2004</Description>
<Description>An acquired defect of cellular immunity associated with infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a CD4-positive T-lymphocyte count under 200 cells/microliter or less than 14% of total lymphocytes, and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignant neoplasms. Clinical manifestations also include emaciation (wasting) and dementia. These elements reflect criteria for AIDS as defined by the CDC in 1993.</Description>
