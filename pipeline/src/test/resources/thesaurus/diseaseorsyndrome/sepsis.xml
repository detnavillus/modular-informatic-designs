<Description>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome with a proven or suspected infectious etiology. When sepsis is associated with organ dysfunction distant from the site of infection, it is called severe sepsis. When sepsis is accompanied by HYPOTENSION despite adequate fluid infusion, it is called SEPTIC SHOCK.Septicemia caused by pyogenic microorganisms (e.g., STAPHYLOCOCCUS; BACILLUS), resulting in the formation of secondary foci of SUPPURATION and multiple ABSCESSES.Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.Sepsis associated with organ dysfunction distant from the site of infection.</Description>
