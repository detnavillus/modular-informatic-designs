<Description>A syndrome of abnormally low BLOOD GLUCOSE level. Clinical hypoglycemia has diverse etiologies. Severe hypoglycemia eventually lead to glucose deprivation of the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM resulting in HUNGER; SWEATING; PARESTHESIA; impaired mental function; SEIZURES; COMA; and even DEATH.HYPOGLYCEMIA expressed after a meal or FOOD INTAKE. It is also called reactive or stimulative hypoglycemia.HYPOGLYCEMIA expressed in the postabsorptive state, after prolonged FASTING, or an overnight fast.</Description>
