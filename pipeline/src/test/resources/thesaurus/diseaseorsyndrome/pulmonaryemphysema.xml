<Description>Enlargement of air spaces distal to the TERMINAL BRONCHIOLES where gas-exchange normally takes place. This is usually due to destruction of the alveolar wall. Pulmonary emphysema can be classified by the location and distribution of the lesions.</Description>
<Description>A subcategory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It occurs in people who smoke and suffer from chronic bronchitis.  It is characterized by inflation of the alveoli, alveolar wall damage, and reduction in the number of alveoli, resulting in difficulty breathing.</Description>
