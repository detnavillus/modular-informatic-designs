<Description>Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). pneumonia resulting from infection with Pneumocystis carinii, frequently seen in the immunologically compromised, such as persons with AIDS, or steroid-treated individuals, the elderly, or premature or debilitated babies during their first three months.  Patients may be only slightly febrile (or even afebrile), but are likely to be extremely weak, dyspneic, and cyanotic. This is a major cause of morbidity among patients with AIDS.</Description>
