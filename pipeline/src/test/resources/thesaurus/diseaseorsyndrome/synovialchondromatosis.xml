<Description>Rare, benign, chronic, progressive metaplasia in which cartilage is formed in the synovial membranes of joints, tendon sheaths, or bursae. Some of the metaplastic foci can become detached producing loose bodies. When the loose bodies undergo secondary calcification, the condition is called synovial osteochondromatosis.</Description>
<Description>An uncommon, benign cartilaginous neoplasm usually occurring in adults.  The nodular tumor arises from the synovial membranes of joints.  It is characterized by the presence of chondrocytes, nuclear pleomorphism, and hyaline cartilage differentiation.
