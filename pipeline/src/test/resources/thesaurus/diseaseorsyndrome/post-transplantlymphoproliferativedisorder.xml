<Description>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a polyclonal (benign) or clonal (malignant) proliferation of lymphoid cells that develops as a consequence of immunosuppression in a recipient of a solid organ or bone marrow allograft.  PTLDs comprise a spectrum ranging from early, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven polyclonal lymphoid proliferations to EBV-positive or EBV- negative lymphomas of predominantly B-cell or less often T-cell type.
