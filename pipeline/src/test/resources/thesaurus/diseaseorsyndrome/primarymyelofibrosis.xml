<Description>A chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, proliferation of atypical megakaryocytes and granulocytes in the bone marrow, anemia, splenomegaly, and extramedullary hematopoiesis.  The cause is unknown.  The median survival time is 3-5 years from diagnosis. (WHO, 2001)</Description>
<Description>A de novo myeloproliferation arising from an abnormal stem cell. It is characterized by the replacement of bone marrow by fibrous tissue, a process that is mediated by CYTOKINES arising from the abnormal clone.</Description>
