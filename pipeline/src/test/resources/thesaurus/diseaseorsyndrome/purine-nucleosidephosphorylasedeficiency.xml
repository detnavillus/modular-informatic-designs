<Synonym>Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase Deficiency</Synonym>
<Description>PNP reversibly catalyzes the phosphorolysis of the purine nucleosides, (deoxy)inosine and (deoxy)guanosine, to their respective purine bases and the corresponding ribose-1-phosphate.  Deficiency in this enzyme is an autosomal recessive cause of combined immunodeficiency.</Description>
