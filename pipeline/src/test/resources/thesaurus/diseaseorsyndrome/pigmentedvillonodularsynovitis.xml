<Description>A locally aggressive, diffusely infiltrating tumor, arising in the tendon sheath.  It is composed of synovial-like mononuclear cells, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, foam cells, and inflammatory cells.  Multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells are usually present, although in a minority of cases they may be absent or rare.  It predominantly affects young adults.  Symptoms include joint swelling, pain, and joint effusion.</Description>
<Description>Outgrowths of synovial membrane composed of villi and fibrous nodules characterized histologically by hemosiderin- and lipid-containing macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. It usually occurs in the knee.</Description>
