<Description>A vitreoretinal dystrophy characterized by splitting of the neuroretinal layers. It occurs in two forms: degenerative retinoschisis and X chromosome-linked juvenile retinoschisis.Splitting of the RETINA into two layers at the level of the outer plexiform layer, beginning as a cystic degeneration in the extreme retinal periphery. It usually occurs after 40 years of age and is generally not progressive.X chromosome recessive disorder, found nearly exclusively in males and becoming apparent around puberty. Characterized initially by a cystlike structure involving the FOVEA CENTRALIS, a peripheral retinoschisis occurs in about half the patients.</Description>
