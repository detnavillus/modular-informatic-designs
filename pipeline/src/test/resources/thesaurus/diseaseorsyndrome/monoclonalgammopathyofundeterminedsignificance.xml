<Description>A plasma cell disorder in which an abnormal amount of a single immunoglobulin is present in the serum. Up to 25% of cases of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) progress to a B-cell malignancy or myeloma. MGUS may occur in conjunction with various carcinomas, chronic inflammatory and infectious conditions, and other diseases.</Description>
<Description>Conditions characterized by the presence of M protein (Monoclonal protein) in serum or urine without clinical manifestations of plasma cell dyscrasia.</Description>
