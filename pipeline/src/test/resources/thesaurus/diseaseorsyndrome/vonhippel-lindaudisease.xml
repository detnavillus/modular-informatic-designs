<Description>An inherited familial cancer syndrome which is characterized by development of capillary hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina; clear cell renal carcinoma; pheochromocytoma; pancreatic tumors; and inner ear tumors. The syndrome is associated with germline mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 3p25-26. Symptoms of VHL syndrome may not be apparent until the third decade of life. CNS hemangioblastoma is the most common cause of death, followed by clear cell renal cell carcinoma. --2004</Description>
<Description>An autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in a tumor suppressor gene. This syndrome is characterized by abnormal growth of small blood vessels leading to a host of neoplasms. They include HEMANGIOBLASTOMA in the RETINA; CEREBELLUM; and SPINAL CORD; PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA; pancreatic tumors; and renal cell carcinoma (see CARCINOMA, RENAL CELL). Common clinical signs include HYPERTENSION and neurological dysfunctions.</Description>
