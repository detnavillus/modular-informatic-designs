<Description>Cessation of ovarian function after MENARCHE but before the age of 40, without or with OVARIAN FOLLICLE depletion. It is characterized by the presence of OLIGOMENORRHEA or AMENORRHEA, elevated GONADOTROPINS, and low ESTRADIOL levels. It is a state of female HYPERGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM. Etiologies include genetic defects, autoimmune processes, chemotherapy, radiation, and infections.A form of ovarian failure, caused by resistance to GONADOTROPINS stimulation. It may be caused by defects in the receptors for FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE or LUTEINIZING HORMONE. It may be due to factors interfering with the actions of gonadotropins, such as antibodies blocking the ligand-receptor interaction.</Description>
