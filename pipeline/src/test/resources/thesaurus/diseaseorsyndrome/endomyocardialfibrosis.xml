<Description>A disease characterized by fibrotic thickening of the endocardium, particularly the right and/or left inflow tracts. The disease often involves the atrioventricular valves, leading to valvular regurgitaion.  It most commonly occurs in children living within 15 degrees of the equator.</Description>
<Description>A condition characterized by the thickening of the ventricular ENDOCARDIUM and subendocardium (MYOCARDIUM), seen mostly in children and young adults in the TROPICAL CLIMATE. The fibrous tissue extends from the apex toward and often involves the HEART VALVES causing restrictive blood flow into the respective ventricles (CARDIOMYOPATHY, RESTRICTIVE).</Description>
