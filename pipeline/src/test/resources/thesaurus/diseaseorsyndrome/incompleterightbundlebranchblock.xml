<Description>Various mechanisms may result in a pattern showing an incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). These include different degrees of conduction delay through the main trunk of the right bundle branch; increased conduction time through an elongated right bundle branch; diffuse Purkinje-myocardial delay due to right ventricular stretch or dilatation; surgical trauma or disease-related interruption of the major ramifications of the right branch ("distal" RBBB or "right fascicular blocks"); congenital variations of the distribution of the major ramifications resulting in a slight delay in the activation of the crista supraventricularis.</Description>
