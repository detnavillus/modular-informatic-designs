<Description>A clinical syndrome characterized by repeated spontaneous hemorrhages and a remarkable increase in the number of circulating platelets.</Description>
<Description>A chronic myeloproliferative disorder that involves primarily the megakaryocytic lineage. It is characterized by sustained thrombocytosis in the blood, increased numbers of large, mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, and episodes of thrombosis and/or hemorrhage.  The cause is unknown.  Median survival times of 10-15 years are commonly reported.  (WHO, 2001)</Description>
