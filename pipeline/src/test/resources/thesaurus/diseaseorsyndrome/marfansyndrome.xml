<Description>An autosomal dominant disorder of CONNECTIVE TISSUE with abnormal features in the heart, the eye, and the skeleton. Cardiovascular manifestations include MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE, dilation of the AORTA, and aortic dissection. Other features include lens displacement (ectopia lentis), disproportioned long limbs and enlarged DURA MATER (dural ectasia). Marfan syndrome is associated with mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin, a major element of extracellular microfibrils of connective tissue.</Description>
<Description>A genetic syndrome inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.  It is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene.  It is characterized by tall stature, elongated extremities, mitral valve prolapse, aortic dilatation, aortic dissection, and sublaxation of the lens.</Description>
