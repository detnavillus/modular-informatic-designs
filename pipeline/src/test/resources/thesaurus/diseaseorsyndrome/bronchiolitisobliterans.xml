<Description>Inflammation of the bronchioles with obstruction by fibrous granulation tissue or bronchial exudate. It may follow inhalation of irritating gases or foreign bodies and it complicates pneumonia.</Description>
<Description>Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES leading to an obstructive lung disease. Bronchioles are characterized by fibrous granulation tissue with bronchial exudates in the lumens. Clinical features include a nonproductive cough and DYSPNEA.A form that is characterized by partial or complete obstruction of bronchiolar lumens resulting from chronic bronchiolar inflammation, scarring, and smooth muscle hypertrophy.A form that is histologically characterized by intraluminal polyps of organizing connective tissue.</Description>
