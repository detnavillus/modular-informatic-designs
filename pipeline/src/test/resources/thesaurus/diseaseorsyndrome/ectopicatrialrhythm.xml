<Description>A cardiac rhythm resulting from either an abnormal electrical focus in the atria or intra-atrial reentry. Atrial ectopic beats (AEB) refer to a contraction of the upper heart chamber which occurs before it would be expected. Atrial ectopic beats are also known as premature atrial beats, premature atrial complex (PAC), or atrial extrasystole.</Description>
