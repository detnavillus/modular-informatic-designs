<Description>A group of inherited disorders of the ADRENAL GLANDS, caused by enzyme defects in the synthesis of cortisol (HYDROCORTISONE) and/or ALDOSTERONE leading to accumulation of precursors for ANDROGENS. Depending on the hormone imbalance, congenital adrenal hyperplasia can be classified as salt-wasting, hypertensive, virilizing, or feminizing. The most common defect is in STEROID 21-HYDROXYLASE. Other defects occur in STEROID 11-BETA-HYDROXYLASE; STEROID 17-ALPHA-HYDROXYLASE; or 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASES).</Description>
