<Description>A disorder of immunoglobulin synthesis in which large quantities of abnormal heavy chains are excreted in the urine. The amino acid sequences of the N-(amino-) terminal regions of these chains are normal, but they have a deletion extending from part of the variable domain through the first domain of the constant region, so that they cannot form cross-links to the light chains. The defect arises through faulty coupling of the variable (V) and constant (C) region genes.</Description>
<Description>One of a group of rare disorders of immunoglobulin synthesis associated with B-cell proliferative disorders and diagnosed by the finding of heavy chains in the serum, urine, or both. Heavy chains are immunologically related to the Fc fragment of the immunoglobulin chain. Three types of heavy chain disease (HCD) have been recognized: gamma heavy chain disease (associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia), alpha heavy chain disease (also known as immunoproliferative small intestinal disease or Mediterranean lymphoma), and mu heavy chain disease (associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Complications of HCD vary depending upon type.</Description>
