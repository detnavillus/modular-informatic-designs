<Description>A rare inherited immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by normal or elevated serum IMMUNOGLOBULIN M levels with absence of IMMUNOGLOBULIN G; IMMUNOGLOBULIN A; and IMMUNOGLOBULIN E. It results in a profound susceptibility to BACTERIAL INFECTIONS and an increased susceptibility to OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS.  Several subtypes of hyper-IgM immunodeficiency syndrome exist depending upon the location of genetic mutation.Hyper-IgM immunodeficiency subtype resulting from mutation in the gene encoding CD40 ANTIGEN.Hyper-IgM immunodeficiency subtype resulting from mutation in the gene encoding activation-induced CYTIDINE DEAMINASE.</Description>
