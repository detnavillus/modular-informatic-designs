<Description>Rare congenital disorder of connective tissue characterized by brachydactyly, joint stiffness, childhood onset of ocular abnormalities (e.g., microspherophakia, ECTOPIA LENTIS; GLAUCOMA), and proportionate short stature. Cardiovascular anomalies are occasionally seen.The autosomal dominant form of Weill-Marchesani syndrome is associated with Adamts10 gene mutations.The autosomal recessive form of Weill-Marchesani syndrome is associated with Fibrillin gene mutations.</Description>
