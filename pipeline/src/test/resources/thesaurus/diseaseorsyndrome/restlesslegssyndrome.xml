<Description>A disorder characterized by aching or burning sensations in the lower and rarely the upper extremities that occur prior to sleep or may awaken the patient from sleep. Complying with an irresistible urge to move the affected limbs brings temporary relief. Sleep may become disrupted, resulting in excessive daytime hypersomnolence. This condition may be associated with UREMIA; DIABETES MELLITUS; and rheumatoid arthritis. Restless Legs Syndrome differs from NOCTURNAL MYOCLONUS SYNDROME in that in the latter condition the individual does not report adverse sensory stimuli and it is primarily a sleep-associated movement disorder.
