<Description>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an acute or chronic inflammation in the pelvic cavity.  It is most commonly caused by sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, that have ascended into the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries as a result of intercourse or childbirth, or of surgical procedures, including insertion of IUDs or abortion.  PID may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic.  It may cause infertility and it may raise the risk of ectopic pregnancy.  PID is a disease associated with HIV infection.</Description>
<Description>A spectrum of inflammation involving the female upper genital tract and the supporting tissues. It is usually caused by an ascending infection of organisms from the endocervix. Infection may be confined to the uterus (ENDOMETRITIS), the FALLOPIAN TUBES; (SALPINGITIS); the ovaries (OOPHORITIS), the supporting ligaments (PARAMETRITIS), or may involve several of the above uterine appendages. Such inflammation can lead to functional impairment and infertility.Inflammation of the uterine appendages (ADNEXA UTERI) including infection of the FALLOPIAN TUBES (SALPINGITIS), the ovaries (OOPHORITIS), or the supporting ligaments (PARAMETRITIS).</Description>
