<Description>An impairment of transmission of the cardiac electrical impulse along the fibers of the left anterior fascicle. In left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) the posteroinferior regions of the left ventricular endocardium are activated abnormally before the anterosuperior left ventricular area. After emerging from the posteroinferior division of the left bundle branch, the impulse first propagates in an inferior, rightward, and usually anterior direction for a short period of time. This orientation is responsible for the small q waves in leads I and aVL and for the r waves in leads II, III, and aVF.</Description>
