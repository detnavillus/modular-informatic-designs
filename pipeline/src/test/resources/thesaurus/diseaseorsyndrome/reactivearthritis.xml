<Description>An aseptic, inflammatory arthritis developing secondary to a primary extra-articular infection, most typically of the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT or UROGENITAL SYSTEM. The initiating trigger pathogens are usually SHIGELLA; SALMONELLA; YERSINIA; CAMPYLOBACTER; or CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS. Reactive arthritis is strongly associated with HLA-B27 ANTIGEN.Historically characterized by a triad of inflammation involving the eye (CONJUNCTIVITIS), the bone (POST-INFECTIOUS ARTHRITIS), and the urethra (URETHRITIS), it is now thought to be nearly synonymous with reactive arthritis.</Description>
