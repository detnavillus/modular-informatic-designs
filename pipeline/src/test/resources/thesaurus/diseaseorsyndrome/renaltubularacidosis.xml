<Description>A group of genetic disorders of the KIDNEY TUBULES characterized by the accumulation of metabolically produced acids with elevated plasma chloride, hyperchloremic metabolic ACIDOSIS. Defective renal acidification of URINE (proximal tubules) or low renal acid excretion (distal tubules) can lead to complications such as HYPOKALEMIA, hypercalcinuria with NEPHROLITHIASIS and NEPHROCALCINOSIS, and RICKETS.The genetic defect is in the anion exchange protein gene SLC4A1 resulting in impaired excretion of hydrogen ions or renal acids in the distal renal tubules.The genetic defect is in the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter gene SLC4A4 resulting in impaired reabsorption of bicarbonate ions in the proximal renal tubules and bicarbonate-wasting.</Description>
