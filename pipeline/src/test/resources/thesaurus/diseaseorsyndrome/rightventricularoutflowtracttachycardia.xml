<Description>Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (RVOT) is the most common type of tachycardia with a female predominance. It is often exercise induced or enhanced. The site of origin is the right ventricular outflow tract and hence the electrocardiographic appearance is that of left bundle branch block and inferior axis. The mechanism is thought to be abnormal automaticity that is sensitive to adenosine.</Description>
