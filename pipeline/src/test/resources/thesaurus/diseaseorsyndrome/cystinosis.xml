<Description>A metabolic disease characterized by the defective transport of CYSTINE across the lysosomal membrane due to mutation of a membrane protein cystinosin. This results in cystine accumulation and crystallization in the cells causing widespread tissue damage. In the KIDNEY, nephropathic cystinosis is a common cause of RENAL FANCONI SYNDROME.</Description>
<Description>An autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized by defective transportation of cystine across the lysosomal membranes and systemic deposition of cystine crystals in the body.  It is associated with slight increase of the plasma cystine, cystinuria, aminoaciduria, glycosuria, polyuria, hypophosphatemia, rickets, and renal tubular dysfunction. --2004</Description>
