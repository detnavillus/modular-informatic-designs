<Description>A disease characterized by normocytic, normochromic anemia, low hematocrit, reticulocytopenia and selective erythroid hypoplasia. It can occur as a chronic or acute form; the former is predominantly seen in adults and the latter in children. Pathogenesis involves immune dysfunction with antibodies directed against erythroid precursor cells or erythropoietin, or due to T-cell mediated suppression of erythropoiesis.</Description>
