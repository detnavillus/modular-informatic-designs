<Description>The inability of the adrenal gland to produce adequate amounts of cortisol.</Description>
<Description>Adrenocortical hypofunction includes all conditions in which adrenal steroid hormone secretion falls below the requirements of the body. Adrenal insufficiency may be divided into two general categories: (1) those associated with primary inability of the adrenal to elaborate sufficient quantities of hormone and (2) those associated with a secondary failure due to a primary failure in the elaboration of adrenocorticotropin. (Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 13th ed, p1970)</Description>
<Description>Conditions in which the production of adrenal CORTICOSTEROIDS falls below the requirement of the body. Adrenal insufficiency can be caused by defects in the ADRENAL GLANDS, the PITUITARY GLAND, or the HYPOTHALAMUS.</Description>
