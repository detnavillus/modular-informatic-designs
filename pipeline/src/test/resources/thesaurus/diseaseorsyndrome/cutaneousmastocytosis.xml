The three major variants are: URTICARIA PIGMENTOSA; diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis; and SOLITARY MASTOCYTOMA OF SKIN.A form of cutaneous mastocytosis that is characterized by a diffuse erythrodermic rash rather than the maculopapular infiltrates seen in URTICARIA PIGMENTOSA.A form of cutaneous mastocytosis that is characterized by the large fluid-filled lesions.</Description>
