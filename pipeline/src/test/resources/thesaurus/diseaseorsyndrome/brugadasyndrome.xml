<Synonym>Brugada Type ECG Pattern</Synonym>
<Description>A condition characterized by a pattern of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST-segment elevation within electrocardiogram (ECG) leads V1-V3. This pattern emerges as a result of a defect in ion channel genes, resulting in abnormal electropysiological activity in the right ventricle and a propensity to malignant tachyarrhythmias.</Description>
<Description>An autosomal dominant defect of cardiac conduction that is characterized by an abnormal ST-segment in leads V1-V3 on the ELECTROCARDIOGRAM resembling a right BUNDLE-BRANCH BLOCK; high risk of VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA; or VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION; SYNCOPAL EPISODE; and possible sudden death. This syndrome is linked to mutations of gene encoding the cardiac SODIUM CHANNEL alpha subunit.A variant of mutations of SCN5A gene encoding the cardiac SODIUM CHANNEL alpha subunit.</Description>
