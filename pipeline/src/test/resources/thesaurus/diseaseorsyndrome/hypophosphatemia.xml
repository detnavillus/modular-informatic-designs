<Description>A condition of an abnormally low level of PHOSPHATES in the blood. Severe hypophosphatemia (below 1 mg/liter) can affect every organ in the body leading to HEMOLYSIS; LASSITUDE; SEIZURES; and COMA. Chronic hypophosphatemia can lead to MUSCLE WEAKNESS; and bone diseases, such as RICKETS and OSTEOMALACIA.</Description>
<Description>Hypophosphatemia; lower than normal levels of phosphates in the circulating blood.</Description>
