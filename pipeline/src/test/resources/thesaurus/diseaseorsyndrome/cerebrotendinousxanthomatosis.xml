<Description>An autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder due to mutation of the gene CYP27A1 encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase. It is characterized by large deposits of CHOLESTEROL and CHOLESTANOL in various tissues resulting in xanthomatous swelling of tendons, early CATARACT, and progressive neurological symptoms.</Description>
