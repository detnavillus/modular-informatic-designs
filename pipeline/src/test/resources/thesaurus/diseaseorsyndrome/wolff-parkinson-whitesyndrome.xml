<Description>A form of ventricular pre-excitation characterized by a short PR interval and a long QRS interval with a delta wave. In this syndrome, atrial impulse conducts to the HEART VENTRICLES via an accessory pathway located between the wall of the right or left atria and the ventricles, known as the bundle of Kent. The inherited form can be caused by mutation of PRKAG2 gene encoding a gamma-2 regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase.</Description>
