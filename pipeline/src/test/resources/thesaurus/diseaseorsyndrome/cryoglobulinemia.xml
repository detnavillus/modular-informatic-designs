<Description>A condition characterized by the presence of abnormal quantities of CRYOGLOBULINS in the blood. Upon cold exposure, these abnormal proteins precipitate into the microvasculature leading to restricted blood flow in the exposed areas.</Description>
<Description>A condition characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood. Cryoglobulins are abnormal proteins that precipitate within the microvasculature on exposure to cold; microvasculature effects of cryoglobulinemia may result in restricted tissue blood flow, tissue hypoxia, and tissue necrosis. --2004</Description>
