<Synonym>Pseudoaldosteronism</Synonym>
<Description>Familial pseudoaldosteronism characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance of hypertension with HYPOKALEMIA; ALKALOSIS; RENIN and ALDOSTERONE level decreases. It is caused by mutations in EPITHELIAL SODIUM CHANNEL beta and gamma subunits. Different mutations in the same EPITHELIAL SODIUM CHANNEL subunits can cause PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT.</Description>
