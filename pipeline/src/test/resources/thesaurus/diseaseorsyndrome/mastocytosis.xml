<Description>A heterogenous group of disorders characterized by the abnormal increase of MAST CELLS in only the skin  (MASTOCYTOSIS, CUTANEOUS), in extracutaneous tissues involving multiple organs (MASTOCYTOSIS, SYSTEMIC), or in solid tumors (MASTOCYTOMA).</Description>
<Description>A heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells in one or more organ systems.  Recent data suggest that most variants of mastocytosis are clonal disorders. (WHO, 2001) -- 2003</Description>
