<Description>Nodular localized form of amyloidosis with predominantly thoracic localization (pulmonary amyloidosis), considered as secondary protein structure disease in which insoluble protein fibrils accumulate extracellularly. The form of primary amyloid in amyloidoma is characterized by abnormal deposition of light chain proteins composed of monoclonal immunoglobulin. Pulmonary amyloidomas are rare and are often found incidentally as solitary or multiple calcified nodules and masses on chest radiographs in asymptomatic elderly patients. Cavitation is rare, the prognosis is good.</Description>
