<Description>A delay in transmission of cardiac electrical impulses in the His-Purkinje system, diagnosed when the QRS is modestly prolonged (&amp;lt; 120 msec) and the QRS pattern and axis are not typical of a hemiblock. The conduction delay is considered to occur beyond the Purkinje's myocardial gates and arises from slow cell-to-cell conduction. The phenomenon is common in patients with acute MI.</Description>
