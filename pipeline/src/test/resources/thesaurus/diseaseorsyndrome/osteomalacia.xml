<Description>A condition marked by softening of the bones (due to impaired mineralization, with excess accumulation of osteoid), with pain, tenderness, muscular weakness, anorexia, and loss of weight, resulting from deficiency of vitamin D and calcium. (Dorland, 27th ed)</Description>
<Description>A metabolic bone disease that results from either a deficiency in vitamin D, or an abnormality in the metabolism of vitamin D, or a deficiency of calcium in the diet.  The most common symptoms are bone pain and muscle weakness.  When it occurs in children it is commonly referred to as rickets. (Diagnostic Surgical Pathology, 3rd ed.) --2003</Description>
