<Description>A group of familial disorders characterized by elevated circulating cholesterol contained in either LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS alone or also in VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS (pre-beta lipoproteins).Type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia is caused by mutation in the receptor-binding domain of APOLIPOPROTEIN B-100 which is a major component of LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS and VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS resulting in reduced clearance of these lipoproteins.  It is characterized by both hypercholesterolemia and HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA (combined hyperlipidemia).Hypercholesterolemia that is caused by mutation in the LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR gene. This receptor defect prevents LDL binding to the cell membrane and uptake of cholesterol which normally suppresses further cholesterol synthesis.</Description>
