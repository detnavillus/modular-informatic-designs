<Description>Benign disorder of infants and children caused by proliferation of HISTIOCYTES, macrophages found in tissues. These histiocytes, usually lipid-laden non-Langerhans cells, form multiple yellow-red nodules most often in the skin, the eye, and sometimes in the viscera. Patients appear to have normal lipid metabolism and are classified as a normolipemic non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis.</Description>
<Description>A benign fibrohistiocytic lesion that occurs during childhood; it is distinct from Langerhans cell histiocytosis.  The lesions usually develop during infancy, and are characterized by regressing cutaneous nodules (most often in the head and neck) sometimes associated with deep soft tissues nodules.  The prognosis is excellent. -- 2003</Description>
