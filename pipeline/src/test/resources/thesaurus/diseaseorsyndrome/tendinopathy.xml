It is characterized by the degeneration of tendons accompanied by an inflammatory repair response, fibroblastic proliferation, and formation of granulation tissue. Tendinitis is not a clinical diagnosis and can be confirmed only by histopathological findings.A disorder of TENDONS characterized by COLLAGEN degeneration, other changes to tenocytes and the EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX, and a lack of inflammatory cells. It is caused by aging, microtrauma, or vascular compromise. Tendinosis is not a clinical diagnosis and can be confirmed only by histopathological findings.</Description>
