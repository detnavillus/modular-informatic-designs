<Description>Variously described as a vasculopathy, endovasculitis, or occlusive arteriopathy, this condition occurs in a benign cutaneous form and a lethal multiorgan systemic variant. It is characterized by a narrowing and occlusion of the lumen of small to medium-sized blood vessels, leading to ischemia and infarction in the involved organ systems. The etiology and pathophysiology are unknown.</Description>
