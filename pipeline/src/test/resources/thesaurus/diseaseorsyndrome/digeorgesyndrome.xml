<Description>A congenital anomaly characterized by immunodeficiency, abnormal facies, congenital heart disease, hypocalcemia, and increased susceptibility to infections. Pathologic characteristics include conotruncal abnormalities and absence or hypoplasia of thymus and parathyroid glands. DiGeorge syndrome is associated with abnormalities of chromosome 22. Also known as DiGeorge anomaly.</Description>
<Description>Congenital syndrome characterized by a spectrum of malformations including the absence of the THYMUS and PARATHYROID GLANDS resulting in T-cell immunodeficiency and HYPOCALCEMIA. Other features include defects in the outflow tract of the HEART and craniofacial anomalies (velocardiofacial syndrome). Most cases result from a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 or mutation in the TBX1 gene.</Description>
