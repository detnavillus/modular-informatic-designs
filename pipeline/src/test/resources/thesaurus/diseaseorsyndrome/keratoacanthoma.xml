<Description>A dome-shaped, rapidly growing skin lesion composed of well differentiated squamous cells.  It represents a proliferation of the infundibular epithelium of the hair follicle and its morphologic distinction from a well differentiated carcinoma may be difficult or impossible.  Keratoacanthomas affect males more frequently than females and the majority tend to regress spontaneously.  It has been suggested that keratoacanthoma represents a distinct subtype of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.</Description>
<Description>A benign, non-neoplastic, usually self-limiting epithelial lesion closely resembling squamous cell carcinoma clinically and histopathologically. It occurs in solitary, multiple, and eruptive forms. The solitary and multiple forms occur on sunlight exposed areas and are identical histologically; they affect primarily white males. The eruptive form usually involves both sexes and appears as a generalized papular eruption.</Description>
