<Description>A congenital or acquired condition of insufficient production of ALDOSTERONE by the ADRENAL CORTEX leading to diminished aldosterone-mediated synthesis of Na(+)-K(+)-EXCHANGING ATPASE in renal tubular cells. Clinical symptoms include HYPERKALEMIA, sodium-wasting, HYPOTENSION, and sometimes metabolic ACIDOSIS.A selective aldosterone deficiency resulting from diminished RENIN-generated ANGIOTENSIN II, a key stimulus to aldosterone secretion. Previously, it was called type IV renal tubular acidosis.</Description>
