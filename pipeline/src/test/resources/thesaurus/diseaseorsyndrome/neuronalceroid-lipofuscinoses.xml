<Description>A group of severe neurodegenerative diseases characterized by intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent wax-like lipid materials (CEROID; LIPOFUSCIN) in neurons. There are several subtypes based on mutations of the various genes, time of disease onset, and severity of the neurological defects such as progressive DEMENTIA; SEIZURES; and visual failure.This type is caused by mutation in the CLN2 gene encoding tripeptidyl-peptidase I, a lysosomal serine protease.This type is caused by mutation in the CLN3 gene encoding a lysosomal integral membrane protein (Battenin).This type is caused by mutation in the gene (CLN1or PPT1) encoding palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (THIOLESTER HYDROLASES), an enzyme involved in catabolism of lipid-modified proteins.</Description>
