<Description>A condition with damage to the lining of the lower ESOPHAGUS resulting from chronic acid reflux (ESOPHAGITIS, REFLUX). Through the process of metaplasia, the squamous cells are replaced by a columnar epithelium with cells resembling those of the INTESTINE or the salmon-pink mucosa of the STOMACH. Barrett's columnar epithelium is a marker for severe reflux and precursor to ADENOCARCINOMA of the esophagus.</Description>
<Description>Esophageal segment lined with columnar metaplastic epithelium which is flat or villiform.  Barrett epithelium is characterized by two different types of cells: goblet cells and columnar cells.  The symptomatology of Barrett esophagus is that of gastro-esophageal reflux.  It is the precursor of most esophageal adenocarcinomas.  (WHO, 2000) -- 2003</Description>
