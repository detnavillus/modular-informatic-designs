<Description>Autosomal recessive neuroectodermal disorders characterized by brittle sulfur-deficient hair associated with impaired intellect, decreased fertility, and short stature. It may include nail dystrophy, ICHTHYOSIS, and photosensitivity correlated with a nucleotide excision repair defect. All individuals with this disorder have a deficiency of cysteine-rich KERATIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS found in the interfilamentous matrix. Photosensitive trichothiodystrophy can be caused by mutation in at least 2 separate genes: ERCC2/XPD and ERCC3/XPB. Nonphotosensitive trichothiodystrophy is caused by mutation in the TTDN1 gene.</Description>
